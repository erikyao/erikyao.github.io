Jake Peralta (Playing seriously in front of a camera)  
  
* This job is eating me alive.  
* I can't breathe anymore.  
* I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat (a mark or symbol of goodness, from the white hats stereotypically worn by law-abiding characters in movie westerns).  
* I'm not becoming like them.  
* I am them.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco (《忠奸人》卧底警察电影).  
* Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco (ten faces in ten screens).  
* What's up?   
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Get it together, man. Okay? (正经点好吗)   
* So the store was hit about two hours ago.  
* They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras.  
  
Jake Peralta (Starts to play a keyboard; stared by Amy)  
  
* Sorry.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store.  
* I'd also like to apologize for my partner.  
* His parents didn't give him enough attention.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Uh, Detective, I already solved the case.  
* We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* And how do you know that?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* I had an informant (a person who supplies information) on the inside.  
* He's been here for years.  
* Watching, learning, Waiting.  
* His code name? Fuzzy Cuddle bear.  
* He's a nanny (保姆) cam (used to monitor children).  
  
Amy Santiago (regretfully)  
  
* Ah, you got lucky.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera.  
* Oh! Hi, bad guys! You did it, fuzzy.  
* You busted 'em.  
* It's time to come home.  
* (mimicing the bear) I'm not sure if I can.  
* I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am.  
* I have seen terrible things.  
* I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* All right.  
  
Jake Peralta (continues mimicing)  
 
* Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me!   
  
Jake Peralta (briefing)  
  
* Yes, I did crack the case.  
* So, Santiago, would you do the honors?   
   
Amy Santiago  
   
* Ohhh! I hate this!   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Ah, yeah.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* I hate this. (plus 1 score to Jake; now 24:22)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* And you're just gonna add one.  
* I'm winning.  
* It's a good feeling.  
* It's a good feeling. Yeah.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Enjoy it while it lasts (趁现在).  
  
Jake Peralta (proudly)  
  
* I will!   
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Yeah! Good news for all you murder fans.  
* Earlier this morning Someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Henry Morgenthau.  
* Body was found by the cleaning lady.   
* During her interview, I deduced, using expert Detective work, that she had something super gross on her chin.  
* (showing the picture in screen; oh~ from the audience)  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* I think it was flan.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Charles thinks it was flan.  
* I think it was butterscotch pudding.  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Maybe it was just old person gunk (any soft, sticky substance).  
* You know how old people always have that gunk on them.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Oldie gunk.  
* Could be, yeah.  
* Anyone else?   
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?   
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Crime techs (technical guys) are at the scene now.  
* We're heading back when they're done.  
  
Terry Jeffords  

* Okay, I want you on this.  
* It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O.  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Wait, tell us about the new Captain.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Captain Holt will be here soon.  
* He'll wanna introduce himself.  
* Dismissed.  
  
Charles Boyle (secretly)  
  
* Hey, Gina.  
* You know any scalpers [ˈskælpə(r)]? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Okay, two points to make here.  
* First, Rihanna? You... And then Rihanna. (come on, you never look like a Rihanna fan)  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Yeah. (I know it)  
* What's your second point?   
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* She's got a type, (pause) which is really anyone but you.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing (这里应该是动作过大, 太冒险的意思), man.  
* I don't know.  
* She's into watching old movies.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Cool.  
* Where would I find a place that shows old movies?   
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase "I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me."  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Great.  
* Thank you. (leave)  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Good.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Uh, no, and I don't care.  
* I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* He was terrible.  
* You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.  
  
(recall starts)  
  
Jake Peralta (Rosa Diaz sit beside)  

* On your marks~~ get set~~ Go.  
  
Captain McGintley (come out from office)  
  
* What the hell's going on around here?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?   
  
Captain McGintley  
  
* Okay. (get into the office; no facial expression)  
* (cheers from spectators)  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* And go! Yeah! (race start; cheers rise around)  
  
(recall ends)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* What's your point?   
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor.  
* I need my rabbi.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Sorry, dude.   
* But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with (start to mimic) "Following every rule~ in the patrol guide."  
* "Meep morp zeep."  
* "Robot Captain Engage". (unconscious of the new Captain behind)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Is that what you think?  
  
Jake Peralta (force a smile)  
  
* He-hey! New Captain alert.  
* You must be the new C.O.  
* I'm Detective Jake Peralta.  
* Great to meet you.  
  
Captain Ray Holt (harshly)  
  
* Now don't let me interrupt (your speech).  
* You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be.  
* I'd like you to finish.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* That's not necessary. (stared by Ray Holt)  
* Or I could recap very quickly, sure.  
* Um, let's see.  
* I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Now do the robot voice.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Which...  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot.  
* I wanna hear it again.  
  
Jake Peralta (embarrassed)  
  
* Meep morp... zarp.  
* Robot. (Amy gloating beside)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* That's a terrible robot voice.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Yep.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Well, your new Captain does.  
* And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.  
* (Pause) Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Speech! (这里明显是拍马, "领导讲两句吧"这样的感觉)   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* That was my speech.  
  
Amy Santiago   
  
* Short and sweet. (embarrassed)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Sergeant Jeffords, a word.  
  
Terry Jeffords  

* Yes, sir. (both into office)  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* I love that guy.  
  
Jake Peralta (falsely)  
  
* Same~~  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* He's so suave [swɑ:v].  
* Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe? (silence around) No? Okay.  
  
(in the office)  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me...though you were significantly...   
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Fatter, sir.  
* They called me "Terry Titties". Because I had large, uh...  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Titties, yes.  
* I remember.  
* I never liked that nickname.  
* Though to be fair, it was accurate.  
* What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?   
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls.  
* Cagney and Lacey. (showing the picture in wallet)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* They have adorable chubby cheeks.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.  
* Lost my edge (锋芒).  
* There was an incident in a department store.   
  
(recall starts)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* I'm fine. I'm fine.  
* Ahhh! (shooting endlessly to a plastic model)   
* (model down)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* I think he's dead.  
  
(recall ends)  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* And I'm still not right.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Tell me about your Detective squad [skwɔd].  
* (both walk to the window)  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Um Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.  
* They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Copy that.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Now the good ones.  
* Rosa Diaz.  
* Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.  
  
(recall starts)  
  
Rosa Diaz (harshly)  
  
* Tell me who has me for secret santa (被选中的人是作为 gift receiver 的, 所以这里是 has 的关系).  
  
Hitchcock  
  
* No! That takes all the fun out of it.  
* (stared coldly by Diaz)  
* It's Scully.  
* He got you a scarf.  
* I'll make him return it (退货).  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Yes, you will.  
  
(recall is over)  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Charles Boyle.  
* He's a grinder.  
* Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else.  
* He's not physically gifted (i.e. clumsy).  
  
(recall starts)  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Oh, man! My muffin.  
* Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the... on my muffin! And my head and my muffin.  
  
(recall is over)  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Amy Santiago.  
* She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.  
  
(recall starts)  
  
Scully  
  
* Careful.  
* That stuff's (片子里是一瓶酱) pretty hot.  
  
Amy Santiago (chanlleging)  
  
* Oh, is it? Hmm? (add a lot to bread; start coughing after one bite)  
  
(recall is over)  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.  
* Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Tell me about Peralta.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Jacob Peralta is my best Detective.  
* He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.  
* The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* That was very well put (表述).  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Look, you know my history.  
* You know how important this is to me.  
* This precinct [ˈpri:sɪŋkt] is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn.  
* And I need your help.  
  
Terry Jeffords  
  
* Absolutely, sir.  
* Where do we start?   
  
Jake Peralta (dancing to Amy outside)  
  
* (singing) What is happening?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* We start with him.  
  
(at crime scene)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with (意思应该是 break) the dish rack.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Shell casing found here.  
* Two shots.  
* Bang, bang.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Great work, Detective.  
* You get a tie (as prize).  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Hey, that's mine.  
* You took it from my desk.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* That's right, Charles.  
* Good solve.  
* Tie for you.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Thanks!   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes, unless you're wearing a tie.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Lay off the Captain. (意思应该是 don't make fun of)  
* That man is gonna be my rabbi.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Okay, first of all, when you use the word "rabbi," you know that turns me on (makes me high) and that's unfair in the work environment.  
* Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Yeah, he's a little too serious.  
* What do you think, Rosa?   
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* He seems cool.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Yeah, he seems cool. I agree.  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon (J 发 H 音) Iberico ham, valued at... what! $6,000!  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* $6,000 for a ham?   
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.  
* They had it at my uncle's funeral.  
* I gorged myself at that funeral.  
* I mean, I was constipated [ˈkɒnstɪpeɪtɪd] for three days.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you.  
* (Charles laughing)  
* All right, listen up, everybody.  
* Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation.  
  
Captain Ray Holt (come from behind)  
  
* Speaking of ties, where's yours, meep morp?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* This is fantastic. (turn around)  
* Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder.  
* What are you doing here?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* I like to know what my detectives are up to.  
* (Is) That okay by you?  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Yep.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Take Santiago and knock on doors.  
* See if the neighbors heard anything.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Door duty? It's a waste of time.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Diaz and Boyle, Check in the coroner [ˈkɒrənə(r)].  
* Report back to me in an hour. (leave the scene)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* That went well.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* (voice from behind) No, it didn't.  
  
Jake Peralta (low down voice)  
  
* He's got (something) like super hearing.  
  
(at the car, on the street)  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Hey, Rosa! Rosa.  
* Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week.  
* Wanna go?   
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Sure.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Cool! Awesome.  
* There's a bunch of movie options.  
* I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Citizen Kane is terrible.  
* Pick a good movie.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Good call.  
* Smart.  
* I'll do it.  
* I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.  
  
Captain Ray Holt (in the office)  
  
* So Gina, civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground.  
* What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?   
  
Gina Linetti (开始作死)  
  
* I will tell you on six conditions.  
* Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves.  
* Second...  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* How about this? If you tell me...  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Mm-hmm.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* I won't have you suspended, (pause) without pay.  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Oh, that sounds great.  
* Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.  
* It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet.  
* If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.  
* He guarantees it will end in sex.  
* I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.  
* At the very least, some touching...  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* No, that's enough, Gina.  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* (continue) caresses.  
* I could see him showing up in a silk robe.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* That's enough, Gina.  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* All right.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Thank you.  
  
(at the crime scene)  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Let the wasting of time begin. (knock on a door)  
  
Man #1   
  
* (open the door; 2 girls smoking weed behind)  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* Hello, sir.  
* Can we ask you a few questions?   
   
Man #1   
  
* Definitely.Yeah.  
* I'm actually I'm super glad you guys are here right now.  
* Are you smelling that weed smell?   
   
Amy Santiago
   
* Yeah.  
   
Man #1   
  
* 'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted.  
* It's……  
   
Jake Peralta  
   
* Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?   
   
Man #1   
   
* Yes.  
   
Jake Peralta (leave; knock on another door)  
   
* Police!  
   
Man #2   
  
* (a weirdo; open the door; nevours)  
   
Amy Santiago  
  
* Hello.  
   
Man #2   
   
* Hello.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* What's your name?  
  
Man #2  

* My name?  

Amy Santiago  

* Mm-hmm.  
  
Man #2  
  
* Mlepnos.  

Amy Santiago (taking note)  

* Can you spell that, please?   

Man #2  

* (slowly) M-l-e-p Clay.  

Amy Santiago  

* Did you say "Clay"?   

Man #2  

* Yes, the "Clay" is silent.  

Amy Santiago  

* All right, got it.  
* Have you seen this man before? He was shot last night.  

Man #2  

* (taking the picture) Oh. Thank you. (close the door)  

Amy Santiago  

* No, sir, that's ours.  
* We need that.  
* We……   

Jake Peralta (smiling)  

* And he kept it.  

Amy Santiago (to a 3rd door)  

* _Wall Street Journal_ on the doormat. Top floor apartment.  
* 20 bucks says this guy's like a hot, eligible bachelor  ['bætʃələ(r)] (学士, 也可以指 a man who is not married, especially a man never married).   
  
Jake Peralta (snuff)  
  
* I'll take that action.  
* (go to knock)  
* Police! Open up!   
  
Man #3 (an old man with oxygen tubes)  
  
* Hello.  
  
Jake Peralta (laugh)  
  
* Oh! Hello, sir! How are you today? I am Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective.  
  
(back to the PD)  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* No surprises from the coroner.  
* 2 gunshots, shoulder and chest.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.  
* And what's worse, Santiago struck out (三振出局) with a 92-year-old.  
  
Amy Santiago (to Captain Ray Holt)  
  
* That is not accurate, sir.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh!   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood.  
* (to Jake Peralta) And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Oh, actually, sir I'm wearing a tie right now.  
* Check it out. (pull the bottom of his shirt to belly)  
* Secret tie. (showing off)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping (manscape, 从 landscape 演化来的一个词, 指脱毛).  
* But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?   
* Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately?   
* (pause; look around) Hmm. Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.  
* I wanna be briefed on any new developments.  
* Any questions?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one.  
* So I'm good.  
  
(Captain Ray Holt leaves)  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Hey, Boyle.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Yep.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* What about this fancy ham stuff?  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Jamon Iberico.  

Jake Peralta  
  
* Yes.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham? It doesn't make sense.  
* Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it?  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Beneficio's might.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Let's go.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* You gotta brief the C.O. first.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* We'll brief him after we catch the guy.  
  
(Beneficio's)  
Ratko  
  
* My name is Ratko.  
* I don't know anything.  
  
Jake Peralta

* Oh, okay.  
* You recognize this guy? Henry Morgenthau[θaʊ]?   

Ratko (avoiding eye contact)  

* No.  

Jake Peralta  

* Maybe actually look at the picture.  

Ratko  

* I don't know him.  
* I don't know what happened.  
* No more questions.  

Jake Peralta  

* Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think? You do know Morgenthau.  
* He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.  
* You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.  
* Only (可以当 but 或者 however 来用) he was home, so you shot him.  
* Does that sound familiar?   
* Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory?  

Charles Boyle  

* Great idea.  

Jake Peralta  

* Okay, yeah.  

Charles Boyle  

* Okay.  
* So I'm I'm Ratko.  

Jake Peralta  

* No, no, I'm Ratko.  

Charles Boyle  

* Come on.  
* I'm always the victim.  

Jake Peralta  

* Look, I'm doing this with you right here.  

Charles Boyle  

* Fine, fine.  
* Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.  
* Don't I know you from the grocery store?   

Jake Peralta  

* Kill! And scene.  

Ratko   
  
* (run to the other end of the store)

Jake Peralta (pull his gun out)  

* NYPD! Everyone down!   
* (a lady passes by calmly)  
* Ma'am, if you could just get down, or... ignore me and continue shopping.  
* Boyle, get the door!   

Charles Boyle  

* On it!   

Jake Peralta  

* Ratko~ (Searching)   
* (pushed to Charles Boyle, both down; Ratko attacking with goods behind the counter)  
* Ratko! I'm getting mad!   

Charles Boyle  

* That's a waste of manchego (曼彻格奶酪)!   

Jake Peralta  

* Charles! (signalling to charles; trying to surround Ratko)   
* (the very lady passes by again)  
* How are you still here?   

Charles Boyle  

* (being pushed in the basins of ice cream)  
* Jake! Little help! Ratko! He's not going anywhere, Jake!   

Jake Peralta  

* Ratko! I got him! I got him! Don't worry!   
* (Ratko runs away)  

(back to the PD)  
Jake Peralta  
  
* So no, I did not brief you.  
* And yes, he did get away.  
* But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut [ˈheɪzlnʌt] (榛子, 此处指榛子冰激凌).  
* And A little spoon there for you.  

(In the narrow records room; a single table)  
Jake Peralta  

* Is he seriously assigning me to the records room? I mean, why do we even have a records room? Computer's been invented, right? I didn't dream it?   

Terry Jeffords  

* You're lucky, man.  
* I wish I could get assigned here full-time.  
* You could not be farther from the action.  

Jake Peralta  

* Sergeant, you know me.  
* I have more arrests than anyone.  
* Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet?   

Amy Santiago  

* Second best.  

Terry Jeffords  

* You're wrong about Holt.  
* That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.  
* In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler.  

(recall starts)  
  
Detective Ray Holt  

* It's over, disco man! Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.  

(recall is over)  

Jake Peralta  

* Wow. (snuffing)  

Charles Boyle  

* The man is the real deal.  
* You need to listen to him. (leaves)  

Amy Santiago  

* Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta.  
* Although I did start a new category.  
* "Murderers we let go".   
* And look at that. You're winning.  
* Have fun with your files. (happily)  

Jake Peralta  

* Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files.  
* Have fun with your face! (tries to slam the door shut, but in vain)  
* Slam! That was a slam.  

(back to the PD)  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* So what movie did you get us tickets to?   

Charles Boyle  

* Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.  

Rosa Diaz  

* Just to be safe? What does that mean?   

Charles Boyle  

* I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up.  
* Because you're sort of... opinionated.  

Rosa Diaz  

* You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you.  
* You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.  

Charles Boyle  

* So we can go see <North by Northwest>.  

Rosa Diaz  

* We're not seeing a movie together.  

Charles Boyle  

* Good call.  
* Smart.  
* Keep it profesh ((informal, oral) professional).  

(evidence lockup)  
Jake Peralta (formally dressed with a tie)  

* Hey, Captain.  

Captain Ray Holt  

* So you found something? Hey, I like the tie.  

Jake Peralta  

* If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  
* Anyway, I think I got something good here.  
* Turns out the name "Ratko" is made up (伪造).  
* But I was digging through these files, one of which I literally found in a spider web. And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a Serbian ['sɜ:bɪən] thug, street names "the rat" and "the butcher", who's known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil. Hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthau's counter.  

Captain Ray Holt  

* That's fine work, Detective.  

Jake Peralta  

* Thank you very much, sir.  
* Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately.  
* (stands up; speedo only, no trousers)  
* Let's pound it out. (6'39'')  

Captain Ray Holt  

* You know what? Such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team.  
* Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here! Bring everyone! And a camera!   

Jake Peralta  

* That's not necessary. (using a file to cover speedo)  
* Oh, they're here!   

Captain Ray Holt  

* Let's have a band of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta.  
* Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone.  
* Give him a hand. (applause rising)  

Rosa Diaz  

* Yeah, nice! Looking good!   

Jake Peralta  

* Yeah. Thank you.  

(waiting and watching in a car; outside the storage unit near Boerum Park)  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* No record of Ratko on the ledger ['ledʒə(r)] (分类帐).  
* Must've used cash.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain.  
* You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is? Patrol guide says "no dress code." (意思是 no requirement on dressing)  
* So I'm just the zip-up hoodie ['hʊdɪ] and my two best friends.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Does he always talk this much?   
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* I just tune it out.  
* It's like a white noise machine.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Okay, first of all, that's racist.  
* Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler.  
* That's incredible. I've read that case.  
* With all due respect, sir, why'd it take you so long to get your first command (意思是怎么才当上 captain)?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Because I'm gay.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Hen hen. Ah. (pause)  
* Seriously?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* I'm surprised you didn't know.  
* I don't try to hide it.  
  
(recall starts)  
  
(post on the wall inside PD: Openly Gay Captain Appointed)  
  
Gina Linetti  
  
* Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* ...... manscapiiiiiiiing.  
  
(recall ends)  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Damn! I am not a good Detective.  
  
(another car on stakeout)  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Here. (hand some money to Charles Boyle)  
* I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Why don't you just go to the movies with me?   
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Nope.  
  
Charles Boyle  
  
* Okay. (take the money)  
* Well, this is awkward.  
  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* It's not awkward.  
* I like your company.  
* You're sweet. (no facial expression still)  
  
(camera back to Jake Peralta's car)  
Amy Santiago  
  
* When did you come out?   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* About 25 years ago.  
* The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective.  
* But then the old guard died out.  
* Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer.  
* I made Captain.  
* But they put me in a public affairs unit.  
* I was a good soldier.  
* I helped recruitment.  
* But all I ever really wanted was my own command.  
* And now I finally got it.  
* And I'm not gonna screw it up.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Captain, I'm sorry.  
* I...I feel like a jackass.  
* But on the flip side, there's Ratko.  
* Humility over. I'm amazing!   
  
(all run into the warehouse; gun pulled out)  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Fantastic. 3,000 identical blue doors.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Looks like we all got door duty.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Ah, yeah. From before. (just like before)  
* (secretly to Amy Santiago) Good one. You look great.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* (move on) Clear.  
* (move on) Clear.  
  
Amy Santiago  
  
* (found a Mrs. Cleaner. motioned her to leave. cleaner refused. Amy pointed to her budget and the 'NYPD' letters on vest. cleaner turned back and pointed to the 'MAINTENANCE' letters on her back)  
* (give up) Okay.  
* Unbelievable! Un-believable!   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* (found a door unlocked) Ah.  
* (Ratko pointed a gun to Jake) Ratko, great to see you.  
  
Ratko  
  
* You can't stop me.  
* I'm going.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Actually, you're not going anywhere.  
* 'Cause if you take a look to your left, you'll see Detective's Boyle and Diaz.  
* Right there is Detective Santiago.  
* And behind you is Captain Holt.  
* Point is, my team has you surrounded.  
* Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing! Captain, I just figured it out.  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Maybe now's not the best time, Detective.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* It's a uniform! We're a team, and the tie is a part of that team's uniform, right?   
  
Ratko  
  
* You ask Ratko what team?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* No, Ratko, shut up.  
* It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.  
* And now you're the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform.  
* Boom! Nailed it!   
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Yes, you did.  
* Now just arrest Ratko.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* All right, Ratko, down.  
* Drop the weapon.  
* Hands on your head.  
* Here we go. (Ratko dropped the gun but ran)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* Hey! He's running!   
  
(Amy knocked Ratko down with a baton)  
Rosa Diaz  
  
* Oh! Got him! Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back! Stay down.  
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* That's how we do it in the nine-nine, sir.  
* Catch bad guys and look good doing it.   
* (a little unnatural)  
  
Captain Ray Holt  
  
* What's wrong with you?   
  
Jake Peralta  
  
* Never took off the speedo.  
* Big mistake.  
* It is inside me.  
* Great work, team!

Jake Peralta

* Ah, Captain.
* You're at my desk.
* Just what I wanna see (as 可省略) first thing in the morning. (Martin Luther King was seen as a hero of democratic movement.)

Captain Ray Holt

* You're three minutes late, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Not my fault.
* I had a plumbing problem.

(recall)

* [Morning alarm] [Groans] [Throw cellphone to toilet]

(recall ends)

Jake Peralta

* Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone.
* Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Good idea.
* Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, fine.
* I was three minutes late.
* I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong.

Captain Ray Holt

* Oh, it's more than one thing.

Jake Peralta

* Uh-oh.

Captain Ray Holt

* Let's start with the Kristov murder.

Jake Peralta

* It was an amazing solve.
* I got him to confess in 20 minutes.

Captain Ray Holt

* You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant (Terry Jeffords) hadn't caught your mistake.
* Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork.
* Here are two pictures.
* One is your locker.
* The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines.
* Can you tell which is which?

Jake Peralta

* That one's the dump?

Captain Ray Holt

* They're both your locker.

Jake Peralta

* Gah, I should've guessed that.
* He's good.

Captain Ray Holt

* This folder is labeled "undies ((plural only, informal) underwear), dirty". 

Jake Peralta

* So I won't confuse it with "undies, clean". 
* Also, who cares about all these rules? I have more felony arrests than any other Detective here.

Captain Ray Holt

* You also have more mice living in your desk than any other Detective.

Jake Peralta

* [Gasps] Algernon (a male given name).
* ['Oh...' from spectators] You guys, Algernon's back.

Captain Ray Holt

* Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now.

Jake Peralta

* (to Algernon the mouse) He's grumpy ['ɡrʌmpɪ] (不愉快です; grump == a grumpy feeling or person).

(briefing)
Terry Jeffords

* Okay, detectives, let's get started.
* Santiago, where are we with the Jay street drug bust [bʌst] ((slang) the act of arresting)? 

Amy Santiago

* There are 12 keys (narcotics 行话, kilogram) of coke [kəʊk] (焦炭, slang 指 Cocaine [kəʊˈkeɪn]) unaccounted for (下落不明), but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment.

Terry Jeffords

* Good.
* Take Boyle and Diaz.

Charles Boyle

* Dream team. (camera to Rosa Diaz)

Terry Jeffords

* Peralta, brief us on the vandalism ['vændəlɪzəm] case.

Jake Peralta

* Well, there's no easy way to put this, sarge, but someone has been painting wieners ['wiːnə] on squad cars.
* [Laughter] And apparently, they won't stop until there's a penis drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn.

Scully

* Oh, that's what he's been drawing.
* But what are those little round things at the bottom? 

Hitchcock

* That's the butt.

Jake Peralta

* The butt? 

Captain Ray Holt

* I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.

Jake Peralta

* Did you just say "['dʒenɪtl] genital-man"? Because if so, kudos [ˈku:ˌdəʊz] (praise given for achievement), and yes, I have a plan.
* I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait.
* Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here.

Terry Jeffords

* He's already tagged three U/C vehicles.
* He can clearly spot 'em.
* You should take my minivan.

Rosa Diaz

* A minivan? A-ha! [Laughter] 

Terry Jeffords

* You all got a problem with my minivan? (laughter stopped)
* 'Cause my wife doesn't like it either.
* She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. (指'车还能跑')
* They roll! 

Captain Ray Holt

* That's a good idea, sergeant.
* We'll take the van.

Jake Peralta

* We? You're coming with me? Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup.

Captain Ray Holt

* It's not backup.
* It's babysitting.

Rosa Diaz

* Babysitting. A-ha! [Indistinct chatter] 

(briefing ends)

Charles Boyle

* Oh, look at this.
* The drug dealer got a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) in art history from Brooklyn college.
* Interesting, huh? 

Rosa Diaz

* How's that interesting? 

Charles Boyle

* Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs.

Amy Santiago

* I studied art history too.

Rosa Diaz

* Also not interesting.

Gina Linetti

* Excuse me.
* I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs? 
* As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you.

Carlene the psychic

* I do palms (手相), tarot (塔罗牌), and I have a degree in numerology (数字占卜术) from the Internet. (hand a business card to Charles Boyle)

Charles Boyle

* Ugh.

Rosa Diaz

* Really, Gina? A psychic? 

Gina Linetti

* What? She's the real deal.
* E.G. (这里直接念 EG), last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous ['sɛnʃʊəs] encounter with a guy named Mark.
* And I did.

(recall; in a bar)  

GL 

* [Rock music] Is anyone here named Mark? (3 guys raised their hands)
* (point to one) You're good.

(recall ends)

Gina Linetti

* Okay, she's had visions which, frankly, science cannot account for.
* Also, she can get you amazing deals on ladies' footwear.
* She's assistant manager at Leonard's designer shoes.

Carlene the psychic

* Vision! (i got the version) The drugs are in a location.
* I see the color blue. 

Gina Linetti

* She sees blue.

Carlene the psychic

* And yellow.
* And I see the letter "L", "R", "S", "T", "W", "E", and "B". 

Amy Santiago

* So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman (一种猜词游戏)? 

Rosa Diaz

* Thank you, Carlene.
* Your entire life is garbage. (left with Amy Santiago)

Jake Peralta

* So Holt's coming on my stakeout now? 
* I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along.

Terry Jeffords

* You made a mixtape? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes, I still listen to cassettes.
* This guy is all over me.
* I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane.

Terry Jeffords

* What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program.
* There is a new sheriff in town, Jake.

Jake Peralta

* Well, I like the old sheriff.
* I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules.

(recall)
All

* Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...

McGintley

* Hey! What the hell's going on here? 

Jake Peralta

* Science experiment.
* I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe [ˈkæntəlu:p] (哈密瓜).

McGintley

* Okay.

All

* Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase Ah! [All oh] Yeah! [electricity cut and a monitor on fire] [Cheers and applause] 

(recall ends)

Jake Peralta

* And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late. 
* 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover (宿醉), and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger.

Terry Jeffords

* Did he let you play your mixtape? 

Jake Peralta

* Okay. That's very funny. (turn around)

Terry Jeffords

* Get an iPod, man.
* Mixtape. (feeling a little unbelievable)

Charles Boyle

* I just want to apologize for my fellow Detective's behavior.
* Okay, my granny also had the gift.

(recall starts)

Charles Boyle's Granny

* (in sickbed, 病床) I feel that I will die soon.

(recall ends)

Charles Boyle

* She was right.
* She died two years later.

Carlene the psychic

* Your sincere belief in my gift means a great deal.
* Vision! The woman you love, the one you work with, the scary one with the black hair...

Charles Boyle

* Rosa? Yes!

Carlene the psychic

* She doesn't love you back.
* She will never love you back.

Gina Linetti

* Say "thank you," Charles.
* She just told you your future.

Charles Boyle

* (残念) Thank you.

(on the minivan, on street)
Jake Peralta

* You left without me.

Captain Ray Holt

* You were late again.

Jake Peralta

* Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise.
* Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret.
* What's your cover? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Angry Captain.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, so you do not like my ensemble ([演出]指服装).

Captain Ray Holt

* I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals [ˈsændl] (凉鞋).

Jake Peralta

* But the sandals define Harvey.
* He's a sandals guy.
* [Sighs] Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me? 

Captain Ray Holt

* You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes.

Captain Ray Holt

* It was a rhetorical [rɪ'tɒrɪk(ə)l] question (反问). (rhetoric ['retərɪk])
* I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously.

Jake Peralta

* Hey, I do take my job seriously.
* I put away bad guys.
* That's what matters.

Captain Ray Holt

* Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear.

Jake Peralta

* That's on Harvey.
* That's not me.

Captain Ray Holt

* Well, so here's the deal.
* You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases.
* And when you show me that you can do your job Every part of your job... perfectly, then I'll back off.

Captain Ray Holt

* Okay.
* Counteroffer.
* I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want. (stared by Captain)
* Fine.
* We'll do it your way.
* From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly.

Captain Ray Holt

* It's "more perfectly". You said that imperfectly.

Jake Peralta

* I was testing you.
* You did perfectly.
* Quick update on the tagger situation. He is currently spray-painting our van right now. (get down the minivan)
* Police, freeze! (chasing)
* Ow, ow, ow. Sandal down. Lost a sandal.

Captain Ray Holt

* NYPD, freeze! 

Jake Peralta

* (catch up) I'm here.
* You're busted.

Captain Ray Holt

* Already got him.

Jake Peralta

* (gasping) We got him.

(back to PD)
Jake Peralta

* Oh, hey, Captain.
* Hi, so I was able to procure [prə'kjʊə(r)] (to get by some effort) that $50 after all, and my offer still stands.
* Let me do whatever I want, and the $40 —— That's how much I actually have —— is yours. 
* (ignored by Captain) No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyway.
* Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is: writing a perfect report.

Captain Ray Holt

* Good, I'm anxious to read it. (迫不及待想要 read it)

Jake Peralta

* And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf.
* [Howls] 

Captain Ray Holt

* Anything else, Detective? 

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, I'm gonna do one more.
* [Howls] Lone wolf. (Captain left)
* (to others) He's digging me. [Clicks tongue, 咂嘴] 
* Hey, sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter (sequin ['si:kwɪn], 亮片)? Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly.

Terry Jeffords

* What are you doing, Peralta?

Jake Peralta

* Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way.

Terry Jeffords

* [Laughs] Okay, man. [Laughs]
* It was nice working with you.

Jake Peralta

* I'm not scared of him, okay? I'm not scared of anyone.
* Oh, also, the tagger drew a penis on your minivan.
* I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me.

Terry Jeffords

* What? There's a penis on my minivan? 

(Jay Street Apartment. The drug case)
Amy Santiago

* High ceilings, three bedrooms.
* Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do? 

Rosa Diaz

* You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.

Charles Boyle

* Oh, no. The cabinets are blue.

Amy Santiago

* Tacky.
* Not a deal breaker, though.
* I'd just repaint it.

Charles Boyle

* The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
* [reclling] [Slow motion] "I see the color blue."
* She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
* [reclling] [Slow motion] "She will never love you back."
* And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing.

AS

* Uh-huh. Kitchen. (意思是'kitchen 归你搜查了')
* Whoa. Jackpot. (Amy found something in bathroom)
* There's way more than 12 keys in here.

Rosa Diaz

* Where was it? 

Amy Santiago

* Baseboard, behind the hamper.

CB

* What color was the hamper?

Amy Santiago

* Green.

Charles Boyle

* Yes.
* The clothes hamper was green.
* The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me (Drinks are on my treat, 我请客).

Rosa Diaz

* [Laughs] You're weird.

(back to PD)
JP 

* (to the tagger) Sorry this is taking so long.
* Still writing up my report. Pretty detailed.
* Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle (月相周期) we're in? 

Gina Linetti

* (playing cellphone) No, sorry.
* Don't feel like it (don't feel like helping you), no.

Jake Peralta

* Thanks, Gina.
* (to the tagger) And now to you.
* What's your name? 

The Tagger

* My name is banana fartman (fart 是'放屁', 也可以是'屁'), md (Medicinae Doctor).

Jake Peralta

* I don't believe you.
* Come on, man.
* Just tell me who you are.
* I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back.
* Are you a minor (未成年)? How old are you? 

The Tagger

* I'm 610.
* I'm a highlander.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there.
* And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander.
* And they're gonna cut your head off.
* Is that what you want? 

Charles Boyle

* I hate to be the bearer (carrier) of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong.

Gina Linetti

* Mm-mm. 
* No way. She's never wrong.

Charles Boyle

* We found the cocaine behind a green hamper.
* Never said green or the letter "H". 

Gina Linetti

* Mm-hmm, she said "blue" and "yellow", Charles.
* I don't know if there's any kindergarteners present (在场), but those two colors combined make green.
* She also mentioned the letters "L" and "B," and another name for a hamper is...

Charles Boyle

* Lady bin? 
* Oh, laundry basket.

Gina Linetti

* Oh, little boo-boo (an embarrassing mistake, 此处的翻译是"傻了吧?").
* Can you go be depressed over there? You're bumming out my whole area.

Terry Jeffords

* (speak to phone) Baby, I've got some bad news.
* Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan.
* No, you cannot have an SUV now.
* Those things roll, baby.
* They roll! 

JP

* Hey, look at this.
* Your prints were on file.
* Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski.
* Oh, Podolski, just like deputy ['depjʊtɪ] (副职) police commissioner Podolski.
* Your father is deputy police commissioner Podolski.

The Tagger

* I'm not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands? 

Jake Peralta

* Okay, you know what? Yes.

(the drug case)
Amy Santiago

* 20.2 kilos.
* I feel like we could round up to 21.

Gina Linetti

* Or we could round down to 20, take the extra 0.2, sell it to our friends.
* [Giggles] (stared by the three)

Amy Santiago

* I'll call the D.A.
* Rosa, you log this in (指文件归档).
* Charles, maybe watch Gina. (Amy left)
* [Laughs from Gina Linetti] 

Rosa Diaz

* So what are you doing tonight? 

Charles Boyle

* Nothing.
* What about you... Are doing tonight? 

Rosa Diaz

* Nothing.

Gina Linetti

* (hinting with the business card) Carlene...

Rosa Diaz

* (trying to play it cool) Whelp, I hope you find something to do.
* [Chuckles] I'm gonna pee. That's what I'm doing tonight.
* No. (forget about it)

Captain Ray Holt

* [Sighs] Deputy commissioner's son, huh? 
* [Jake Peralta Sighs] His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now.

Jake Peralta

* We gotta let him walk, right? 

Captain Ray Holt

* He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed.
* Why would you let him walk? 

Jake Peralta

* [Chuckles] Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly.
* I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous [məˈtɪkjələs] (marked by extreme or excessive care) research, diagrams, and maps.
* I even put an "about the author" section on the back.
* I did everything you asked me to do, but this is above my pay grade.
* You gotta make the call.

Captain Ray Holt

* You're the arresting officer.
* It's your call.
* I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, but you think I should process him.

Captain Ray Holt

* Mm-hmm.

Jake Peralta

* Well, if I do, the deputy commissioner could ruin my career, and I'll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans.

Captain Ray Holt

* Mm-hmm.

Jake Peralta

* Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes.

(the drug case)
Charles Boyle

* Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa.

Carlene the psychic

* Who's Rosa? 

Charles Boyle

* The woman I... 

Gina Linetti

* The woman who doesn't love him back.

Carlene the psychic

* Oh.

Charles Boyle

* Yes, that woman.

Carlene the psychic

* You know, it can be a burden to always know what's gonna happen in the future. (Charles Boyle trying to leave)
* Don't get out of the chair.
* I just had a vision of you leaving this chair and getting seriously injured.

Charles Boyle

* Oh, my God.

Gina Linetti

* I should probably wheel you back to your desk.

Carlene the psychic

* That is a great idea.

Gina Linetti

* Wheel you off a bridge.
* [Laughs] I'm kidding.
* [Singing] Oh, you're alone~ Uh-oh, you're alone for life~ 

(meeting)
Jake Peralta

* So here are my options.
* One, I process Podolski's kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a Detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic.
* No offense, Hitchcock.

Hitchcock

* None taken.

Jake Peralta

* Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter. (Amy smiling)
* Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she's kind of a cute blonde named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want.

Amy Santiago

* How old are you in this scenario? 

Jake Peralta

* Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I "do my job right" than whether I have a job at all.
* So I'm taking suggestions.

Amy Santiago

* I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, thank you for that, Santiago.
* I'm gonna put you down (记上一票) for "don't arrest", and I'm also going to put your phone number on every urinal [jʊ'raɪn(ə)l] in Rikers.

Rosa Diaz

* Don't arrest him.
* Just smack him. 
* Hard.
* With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I'm saying? 

Jake Peralta

* So you're suggesting police brutality? 

Rosa Diaz

* Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why? 

Jake Peralta

* Hey, Scully. (Scully right came in)

Scully

* Yeah? 

Jake Peralta

* You want this collar? Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect.

Scully

* The Podolski kid? Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.
* Boyle, what do you think? 

Charles Boyle

* I don't know, man.
* I'm lost.
* The universe is a cruel and vexing (vex == annoy or puzzle) puzzle.
* I...I'm at the whim (a sudden decision, 心血来潮) of the cosmos.
* All right, I'm gonna put you down for "bummer", and you can hang out in that category all by yourself.

Gina Linetti

* Hey, everyone~~~
* Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy, angry official here, deputy commissioner Podolski.
* He's asking for you.
* Very angry.
* Elderly, sexy, furious.

Jake Peralta

* Well, my career is over.
* See you at the bottom (指底层阶级), Hitchcock.
* No offense.

Hitchcock

* No, none taken.

Jake Peralta

* Deputy commissioner.

Deputy Commissioner

* Where's my son? (still reading some files; ignoring Jake Peralta)

Jake Peralta

* He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion.

AS (come by on purpose)

* Hey, Peralta, when you're done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? Thanks.
* Oh, deputy commissioner, didn't see you there.
* Sorry for interrupting.
* Amy Santiago. (leave)

Deputy Commissioner

* [Sighs] Trevor, what'd you do this time? 

The Tagger

* Nothing.

Deputy Commissioner

* There you have it.
* He said he did nothing.

Jake Peralta

* So I caught him red-handed doing nothing? 

Deputy Commissioner

* I'm saying maybe it's a possibility you made a mistake.

Jake Peralta

* You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I've been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours.

Deputy Commissioner

* You might not understand this, but Trevor is a special kid.
* He makes straight "A"s.
* He's going to Duke next year.
* Lacrosse [lə'krɒs] scholarship.

Jake Peralta

* Oh.

Deputy Commissioner

* Sometimes, boys just need to be boys.

Jake Peralta

* You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles.

Deputy Commissioner

* Look, I think we can all agree that I'm ordering you to let this slide because nothing happened.
* This is officially out of your hands.

Jake Peralta

* Would you actually mind just checking out my report? It's pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts. 
* Kinda snazzy (attractive and stylish; fancy), so... 

Deputy Commissioner

* Oh, thank you.
* I'll get right to it. (receive the report handed over)
* Thanks.
* Trevor, let's go. (dispose the report to the bin)

Jake Peralta

* Have a good one.

Charles Boyle

* Choo.
* Yes. (wheel the chair to the refrigerator)

Rosa Diaz

* What's up with the chair? 

Charles Boyle

* Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I'd get badly hurt, so I'm not chancing it. (冒险)
* Oh, man.
* There's no pudding cups left. (Rosa Diaz smacked Charles Boyle in the arm. Hard)
* Ah! What'd you do that for? 

Rosa Diaz

* There.
* Now you're hurt in this chair.
* You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle.
* And if you do, it won't be because some shoe salesman predicted it.
* You make your own destiny.

Jake Peralta

* Well, we don't have to worry about Podolski's son anymore.
* The case is officially out of my hands.
* No charges filed.

Captain Ray Holt

* Why is there yogurt on this? 

Jake Peralta

* The deputy commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yogurt earlier.

Captain Ray Holt

* Terry loves yogurt.
* Something wrong? 

Jake Peralta

* Kinda, yeah.
* I called six precincts about this kid.
* He's been brought in a dozen times.
* Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he's never been processed.
* His daddy comes in and bails him out every time.
* He's a lucky little jerk.

Captain Ray Holt

* No, I wouldn't say he was lucky.
* I feel bad for this kid.
* I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything? Well, he's someone else's problem now.
* Like you said, it's out of your hands.

Jake Peralta

* All right, I see what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work.
* I'm not going to arrest him.
* I'm going to arrest him!

Captain Ray Holt

* You want backup? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes.

(On the street; police car following Deputy Commissioner's van) [Siren wails]
Deputy Commissioner

* (get down the van) What is this? You can't do this.
* Get that thing outta here.

Jake Peralta

* Excuse me, sir.
* Trevor Podolski, you're under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property.

The Tagger

* What...dad! 

Deputy Commissioner

* What are you doing? I told you to back off, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* First off, the name's Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago.
* Second, I'm arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it's the one I'm making.
* Once again, my name is Amy Santiago.

Deputy Commissioner

* You're being stupid, Peralta.
* Don't be stupid.
* I can make your life miserable.

Captain Ray Holt

* Commissioner, please don't talk to my Detective in that Tone.
* If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me.

Deputy Commissioner

* You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, Holt.
* I'm gonna be watching you, both of you, like a hawk.

Captain Ray Holt

* You're gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me.
* I've been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you're not the first superior officer to threaten me.
* You know how I'm still standing here? 'Cause I do my job, and I do it right.

Jake Peralta

* Damn, son! 

Captain Ray Holt

* Don't say "son". 

Jake Peralta

* Sorry.
* Deputy commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he'll be at the nine-nine.
* Let's go, fartman.

(back to the PD; morning briefing)
CB 

* (talking to Gina Linetti at the door of the meeting room)
* Carlene was wrong, Gina.
* Rosa said it herself I'm in charge of my own destiny.
* That means she wants me to make a move.

Gina Linetti

* Mm, but Carlene was also right.
* You did get hurt 'cause Rosa punched you.
* And the fact that Rosa punched you means she does not like you.

Charles Boyle

* No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong.

Rosa Diaz

* Move! (walk into the meeting room) (翻译是'死开', 好评)

Gina Linetti

* Oh, wait, I take it back.
* She definitely is into you.
* So much 'chemistry'.

Charles Boyle

* I know, it's crazy.

Captain Ray Holt

* All right, let's get this meeting started.

Jake Peralta

* I'm not late. (get out from a tent beside)
* I'm here.

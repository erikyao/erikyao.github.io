Amy Santiago

* For the last time, the best cop movies, in order, Training Day, Lethal Weapon, and Fargo.
* End of discussion.

Jake Peralta

* Wrong.
* Die Hard is the best cop movie of all time.
* One cop heroically saving the day while everyone else stands around and watches.
* It's the story of my life.

Charles Boyle

* I like Turner & Hooch.
* Tom Hanks, reluctant (unwilling) friendship with a dog.
* That hits me where I live.

Rosa Diaz

* No.
* Robocop.
* It's got everything I like. 
* Gratuitous [grə'tjuːɪtəs] violence.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, I thought you were listing things.

Rosa Diaz

* I was. I'm done.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.

Gina Linetti

* Let's talk Bad Boys.
* That's the perfect cop movie.
* Mr. Smith, lookin' fine.
* A hot cup of tea Leone. Come on.

Terry Jeffords

* Francois Truffaut's~ Breathless.
* What? Terry likes foreign films.

Jake Peralta

* Mm-kay.
* There is a correct answer to this question, though.
* So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time.
* Please refrain from texting during our presentation.

* (from screen monitor) Excuse me, ma'am.

* All right, so there's Hitchcock.
* And there's an old hooker.

* (from screen monitor) There it is! (the hooker kicked Hitchcock) 

Hitchcock

* Come on, guys, that happened four years ago.

Jake Peralta

* Shh, this is the best part.
* She comes back, takes the wallet and here she goes! (another kick. Oh~ from audience)

(before briefing)
Jake Peralta

* Hey, (I) love the sweater.
* Who are you slayin' tonight, lady killer? 

Charles Boyle

* Well, we shall see what we shall see.

Jake Peralta

* No, you're dressed exactly like the lady killer. (pointed to the wanted poster on the wall)

Charles Boyle

* Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's (the Milwaukee Cannibal) corduroys ['kɔːdərɒɪs] all over again. (这里指的应该是 CB 之前和 Jeffrey Dahmer 的灯芯绒裤子撞衫的事件)

Terry Jeffords

* All right, let's get started.
* Scully, where are you on digitizing the old case files? 

Scully

* As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done.

Terry Jeffords

* Why are you smiling? That's nothin'.

Scully

* There are thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out 200 little box thingies on 50 different screens.

Rosa Diaz

* At least you get to sit on your butt all day.

Scully

* That's actually the worst part.
* My doctor said I have an anal canyon (肛裂).

Jake Peralta

* Ugh, God, Scully, why are you always telling us about your disgusting body? 

(recall starts)  
(Scully's left foot full of yellow cream)  

Jake Peralta

* I don't see anything.

Scully

* That's because it's all wart (疣).

(recall ends)

Jake Peralta

* How are you married? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Peralta, where are we on the Adams street burglary? 

Jake Peralta

* We are very close, Captain, aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads.
* So, in conclusion, not at all close.

Captain Ray Holt

* And the Vickers street aggravated assault? 

Jake Peralta

* Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved, due to a lack of solving it by me.

Gina Linetti

* Sounds like someone's in a little bit of a slump.

Jake Peralta

* I'm not in a slump.

Amy Santiago

* You're not? Scoreboard (35-44).

Jake Peralta

* I don't slump, people.
* I opposite slump.
* I p-muls.
* That's "slump" backwards, and it's what I do.
* I p-muls all over this bitch.

Terry Jeffords

* Dismissed.

Amy Santiago

* Slump.

Jake Peralta

* P-muls! 

(brief ends. at desk)  
Jake Peralta

* Wait before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face.
* Someone died.
* No! You won a prize! 
* (Give up guessing)I'm not getting better at this.

Captain Ray Holt

* I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.

Jake Peralta

* All right, sir.
* Let me hit you with a little analogy.
* Are you familiar with race cars? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Formula 1 or stock (一般的赛车)? 

Jake Peralta

* That's already way more than I know about it.
* The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps.

Captain Ray Holt

* You got speed bumps on a race track? 

Jake Peralta

* Is that not part of car racing? It should be.
* All I'm saying is, it's open road again.
* I'm about to close a case.
* Missing grandma Helen Sterrino.
* Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels ['beɪg(ə)l] and never came back.
* This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly.
* I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, (mimicing) "That's my grandson." 

Captain Ray Holt

* What did I say about doing voices? 

Jake Peralta

* I'm a storyteller, sir.
* It's my craft.
* Anyways, grandson's coming in.
* They reunite, and I throw another case on the old "solved it" pile.
* (The file pile fall off desk) Hey, my croissant [krəˈsɑnt].

(at office)  
Amy Santiago

* You wanted to see me, Captain? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes, the D.A.wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay street drug bust.

Amy Santiago

* That's why we do this, sir.

Captain Ray Holt

* For praise? 

Amy Santiago

* Uh... 

Captain Ray Holt

* There's a community outreach program that's very important to me.
* I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.

Amy Santiago

* Absolutely, sir.
* I won't just head it up, I will head and shoulders it up.
* I will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it.

Captain Ray Holt

* Be more articulate [ɑ:'tɪkjʊleɪt] (able to express clearly) when you speak to the children.

Amy Santiago

* Yes, sir, I will make better mouth.

Charles Boyle

* Hey, sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup (指列队供 victim 辨认).
* Will you be scary Terry? 

Terry Jeffords

* Oh, I love being scary Terry.
* He says what regular Terry's thinking.

(recall starts)  
Terry Jeffords

* This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market! 

(recall ends)

Terry Jeffords

* But I'm too busy.
* I've got a special case I'm working on.
* Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup.

Hitchcock

* Oh, great.
* I'll take my shirt off.

Charles Boyle

* No one asked you to take your shirt off.
* Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.

Hitchcock

* I can't hear you! Shirt's over my ears.

Amy Santiago

* Hi, Rosa.
* Ooh, I like your shoes.
* They're a really pretty...

Rosa Diaz

* What do you need? 

Amy Santiago

* ...Color.
* Okay. You know how, every year, the precinct does that Junior police program seminar? 

Rosa Diaz

* That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches (告密者)? 

Amy Santiago

* No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids...

Rosa Diaz

* Losers.

Amy Santiago

* ...to sign up to become Junior police officers.

Rosa Diaz

* Snitches. What about it?

Amy Santiago

* Captain specifically [spɪ'sɪfɪkəlɪ] asked me to run it this year.
* I signed you up to do it with me.
* Here's the info.

Rosa Diaz

* Now I gotta read something? 

Gina Linetti

* Greetings.
* Fine.
* I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.

Amy Santiago

* I don't need your help.
* It's nothing personal, it's just... you're not a cop, so I'm not really sure you could help.

Gina Linetti

* Okay.
* No hard feelings.
* But I hate you.
* Not joking.
* Bye.

Jake Peralta

* Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.
* I'm glad you're here.
* May I present to you —— 

The Old Lady

* Oh, my darlings.
* Thank God I found you.
* Oh, look at those beautiful cheeks.

Mr. Terrino

* I have no idea who this lady is.
* I've never seen her before in my life.

Jake Peralta

* What? No, she recognized you.
* This is Helen.

The Old Lady

* Who's Helen? 
* Oh! That's my husband. Solomon! (hugging CB)

Charles Boyle

* I'm... I'm not really her husband.

The Old Lady

* You're so much shorter than you used to be.
* What did the Japanese do to you? 

Jake Peralta

* Different generation.

Charles Boyle

* Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the prospect heights senior center.
* There was an I.D. card in her back pocket.

Terry Jeffords

* Why was your hand in her back pocket? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and, unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress [kə'res] (抚摸) her butt.

Charles Boyle

* Frisked (搜身)! I frisked her butt! 

Captain Ray Holt

* It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, my God.
* I'm in a slump! 

(after)  
Jake Peralta

* Oh, cool.
* You're all here in the break room.

Rosa Diaz

* You asked us to come in here.

Jake Peralta

* What? Here's a hypothetical question.
* Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump.
* What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that? 

Charles Boyle

* Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce.
* So I'd tell this person, "maybe get divorced".
* He'd have to get married first.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced.
* Rosa? 

Rosa Diaz

* Fly to Montreal, hit (find) a classy hotel bar, bone (vulgar, slang, of a man, to have sex with) a stranger, slump over.

Charles Boyle

* Wow, that sounds amazing.

Rosa Diaz

* Yeah.

Charles Boyle

* That's a good one.

Jake Peralta

* Sarge, what would you do? 

Terry Jeffords

* 10,000 sit-ups (仰卧起坐).

Jake Peralta

* Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9,500 or 3?

Captain Ray Holt

* What's going on in here? 

Charles Boyle

* We're helping Jake's friend got out of his slump.

Captain Ray Holt

* Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta.
* I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump.

Jake Peralta

* Thank you, Captain! 

Terry Jeffords

* He's right.
* You just need a win.
* Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.

Jake Peralta

* Fine! Right after I do Rosa's Montreal sex thing.
* That sounds fun.

Rosa Diaz

* Yeah.

(to a row of teenagers)  
Amy Santiago

* Okay, this is the Junior Police Program.
* Aka "mission possible". (007 music starts) 
* Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get your life back on track.

Gina Linetti

* (came in) Er! Narc [nɑ:k] (narcotic [nɑ:'kɒtɪk] officer)! (laugh from teenagers)

Amy Santiago

* Hey, Gina.
* What are you doing? (fake smile)

Gina Linetti

* Oh, hi, Amy.
* Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn.

Amy Santiago

* (turn to RD; quietly) Do you wanna help me out here? 

Rosa Diaz

* Nah, I think I'm good.

Amy Santiago

* (turn to teenagers) I know you think getting in trouble is cool.
* But let me show you what can happen if you continue down this path.
* (rapping) Hey, yo, I'm an at-risk kid, and I think it's cool to sell drugs.

A Boy

* Hold up! Why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black? 

Amy Santiago

* He's not.

Gina Linetti

* Well, why not? Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs? 

AS

* No, I'm not saying that.

The Boy

* We have a black President.
* Why can't black people sell drugs? 

Amy Santiago

* (to herself) I'm so confused.

Gina Linetti

* Black people can sell drugs! 
* (together with teenagers) Black people can sell drugs! Black people can sell drugs! Black people can sell drugs! Black people can sell drugs! Black people can sell drugs! 
* (Cap came to see what's happening)

(CB hearing at the door)  
Terry Jeffords

* Don't make me hit you again.
* (CB came in) Um... I'm building this dollhouse for my girl.
* It's her birthday tomorrow.
* I told my wife I'd get it done.

Charles Boyle

* I had the same exact one when I was a kid! 

(recall starts)  
Charles Boyle's sister

* Mom, Charles is hogging my dollhouse!

Charles Boyle

* Grandma bought it for the both of us! 

(recall ends)

Charles Boyle

* You want some help, big man?

Terry Jeffords

* No! I can do this.
* It's just driving me a little crazy.
* Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?
* Where do I affix it? 

Charles Boyle

* On the side of the turret [ˈtə:rɪt] (角楼)... 

Terry Jeffords

* Not now, Boyle.
* Let a brother breathe (让哥缓缓).
* Let a brother breathe.

Hitchcock

* Why would I swap cases with you? I got multiple calls that a guy in the Sackett Towers is dealing meth [meθ] (Methamphetamine [ˌmeθæm'fetəmi:n] 甲安菲他明) out of his apartment.
* It's a guaranteed arrest.

Jake Peralta

* And therefore we'll have a ton of paperwork, which I know you hate.
* I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence.
* It's unsolvable, and thus... shall have no paperwork.

Hitchcock

* You had me at "no paperwork". 

Jake Peralta

* That was the very end of the sentence.
* All right, Boyle.
* Let's hit it.

Captain Ray Holt

* So where are you going, Peralta? 

Jake Peralta

* I am on my way to ending the slump.
* I got a dunker, Captain.
* Nothin' but net.

Charles Boyle

* Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake hammer.

Captain Ray Holt

* So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one.
* I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen-Sterrino-missing-grandmother case first? 

Jake Peralta

* Or I could solve the super easy one, get my mojo (a magic spell) back, and move on to catching the zodiac killer.
* Am I getting ahead of myself? 

Charles Boyle

* No, you are not, Jake rabbit.

Jake Peralta

* I like Jake hammer better.
* Let's go. Ah.

Amy Santiago

* (outside with RD)
* I did not think getting these kids to sign up would be this hard.

Rosa Diaz

* These kids don't wanna listen to you.
* You're like... smart and articulate.

Amy Santiago

* So are you! Why am I offended by that? 

Rosa Diaz

* They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets.
* I am.
* Follow, watch, learn.

Rosa Diaz

* (come in again) All right, listen up.
* I know you think you're badasses.
* But deep down, you're scared.
* How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid.
* And if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail.
* Got it? 

A Boy

* (recording and made a remix using an app) Remix, yo! 
* *Throwing you in jail. Throwing you in jail. Got it?*
* *Throwing you in jail...* (laughing)

Rosa Diaz

* (to AS; quietly) What's happening? 

Amy Santiago

* I think they're laughing at you.
* That's never happened before.
* I don't like it. (*Got it?*) 

(Sackett Towers)  
Jake Peralta

* (break into) Freeze! NYPD, hands where I can see them.

An Old Man

* Don't shoot! I was just practicing my minuets [mɪnjʊ'et] (小步舞(曲)), but I'll hold it down.

Jake Peralta

* All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment? Where's the dealer? 

The Old Man

* I live here alone, with my birds.

Jake Peralta

* What, you don't think I know this M.O.? 
* These are mules.
* They're drug mules.
* They're bird mule drugs.
* Drug bird mules.

Another Officer

* Apartment's clear.

Jake Peralta

* We got multiple calls about a dealer here.

The Old Man

* I bet it's the silly kids down the hall.
* They love prank calling me.
* The only drugs in this apartment are for my heart, my liver, my kidney, my salivary glands (腺), and my penis and my feet.

Charles Boyle

* (gun down; to JP) Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder.
* No, wait... pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder.

(back to PD)
Charles Boyle

* I'm telling you, it's good luck.

Jake Peralta

* No, it isn't, okay? That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible.

Hitchcock

* Fore, comin' in! 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, come on.

Hitchcock

* I was at the crime scene.
* This guy comes up out of nowhere, confesses.
* Well, he says he's gotta make things right, so helps me track down his accomplices.

Jake Peralta

* That is so great, man.
* Looks like everything's comin' up, Hitchcock.

(in men's room)  
Gina Linetti

* Hey, Jake.
* You busy? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes, I very clearly am busy.

Gina Linetti

* The medical examiner's office just called.
* They mishandled some evidence.
* So the D.A.'s gonna have to dismiss your last two busts.

Jake Peralta

* Great.
* And the slump gets worse.

Gina Linetti

* I don't think it's a slump.
* Honestly, you are straight-up cursed.

Jake Peralta

* Good to know.
* (water spray out)
* Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina? 

Gina Linetti

* (a paper with "Fill Me Please !!" attached)
* There's no more left.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, that sounds right.

Jake Peralta

* (to Cap's office) Hey.

Captain Ray Holt

* You're dripping on my carpet.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, don't worry, sir.
* It's just urinal water.
* Clean urinal water.

Charles Boyle

* You could eat off his shirt.

Captain Ray Holt

* Why would I ever eat off his shirt? 

Jake Peralta

* Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed.

Captain Ray Holt

* Cursed, huh? 

Jake Peralta

* The freakiest things have been happening to me.
* I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life.
* Birds are unloading on me left and right.
* And, two seconds ago...

(recall starts)

* Jake Peralta

* Hey, sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here? I... 
* (knock down the dollhouse)

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* Cursed.

Captain Ray Holt

* Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before.
* It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8.
* Detective Smith.
* We called him Smitty.
* He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed.

Jake Peralta

* But then he found a case, and he solved it, and now he's married to Kate Upton (美國著名模特).

Captain Ray Holt

* No.
* No one would go out on calls with him.
* He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team.
* It was actually quite violent.

Charles Boyle

* Man! Girls are so scary.

Captain Ray Holt

* I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta.
* I'm pulling you from casework.
* You can digitize old files with Scully.

Jake Peralta

* You're benching me? No, no, no, look, I've got a plan.
* Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me 20 fresh ones. Eventually, my luck will turn.

Captain Ray Holt

* No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad.
* Not until this (slump or curse) blows over.

Jake Peralta

* And how long will that be? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Could be a week. Could be a month.

Charles Boyle

* Could be a year.
* Could be a decade.
* Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers.

Amy Santiago

* I don't know how to connect with these kids.
* They're mean and shallow and respect nothing.
* I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to? 

Gina Linetti

* Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little Tupperware (商标名) containers (其实是保鲜盒).
* It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it.

Hitchcock

* Sorry! 

Amy Santiago

* (wink to RD) Hey, Gina.
* That's a super cute... 

Gina Linetti

* What do you want? 

Amy Santiago

* ...Sweater.
* Okay.
* Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.

Gina Linetti

* Mm, I thought only cops could help.

Rosa Diaz

* In this case, not being a cop might actually be better.

Gina Linetti

* Mm, that's true.
* In all cases, cops are the worst.

Jake Peralta

* "Enter the numbers from this report into the corresponding boxes on the screen. Then fill out these fields." And I'm in a coma.
* Hey, Hitchcock. Help me out, man. I'm so bored.
* Let me jump back on that murder with you.

Hitchcock

* No.
* I got it.

Jake Peralta

* Come on, man, let me just... 

Hitchcock

* No, don't touch it (files)! You're contagious [kən'teɪdʒəs].
* Everything could fall apart! 

Captain Ray Holt

* Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here.
* I got in touch with Smitty.
* He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger (食指) and your pinky (also pinkie, 小指), like this, for good luck.
* Okay? Now you try it.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.
* Yep.
* It's definitely helping.
* I can feel it.
* The curse is lifting off of me.
* Ah, hand cramp (抽筋)! 

Captain Ray Holt

* (walk away) Rub, rub, rub.

Charles Boyle

* You okay? 

Terry Jeffords

* (frustrated) The fairy princess castle has defeated me.
* I'm a grown man, with man hands and a man brain.
* I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours.
* Why does it have to be so hard? 
* Look, this screw (螺钉) has three pointy sides, and nowhere to screw it in! 
* And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? 
* (going crazy and destroy it at all)

Jake Peralta

* 117a, yes. 
* 117b, yes.
* 118a...
* Wait a minute. (grasp some files and stand up)
* (noticed by Cap) Hey, just heading to the can (slang, rest room).

Captain Ray Holt

* Take the rabbit's foot.

Jake Peralta

* Roger that.

Charles Boyle

* (secretly; in rest room) Hey. 

Jake Peralta

* Hey.

Charles Boyle

* What's going on? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here.

Charles Boyle

* So what you're saying is that this is kind of a... 

Jake Peralta

* No, for the last time, Charles, we don't need a clubhouse.

(recall starts)  

Charles Boyle

* Clubhouse! Clubhouse.
* You know what I'm thinking.

Jake Peralta

* No clubhouse.

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* I need you to make these calls for me.
* Don't let Holt see you.
* But if my hunch (a strong intuitive feeling, 预感) is right, the slump is over.
* Come through for me, Boyle.

Charles Boyle

* You know I will.

Jake Peralta

* All right.

Charles Boyle

* I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here...

Jake Peralta

* Go! 

Gina Linetti

* Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers.
* Is that a trucker hat? Still? Come on.
* Your problem Is that you don't have passion for anything.
* My life turned around when I found my passion.
* And today, well, I hope to inspire you with it.
* (dancing to Christina Aguilera's Beautiful) *Mm-mm-hmm-hmm / You are beautiful / No matter what they say / Words can't bring you down / No, no, no / You are beautiful / In every single way* 
* What are we thinking? Yes, in the denim.

The Girl in Denim

* I think I speak for everyone when I say your weird dancing was just weird.

Gina Linetti

* Fine.
* Cops make $52,000 a year.
* You never have to stop at a red light.
* And you get to carry a gun.
* Who wants in? 
* (raising hand) Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
* Yes.

Amy Santiago

* Oh, my God.
* You got eight kids to sign up.
* How did you know that would work? 

Gina Linetti

* That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.

Rosa Diaz

* You did this program? 

Gina Linetti

* Mm-hmm. Yeah.
* It does not work.

Charles Boyle

* (come in rest room) They're here.

Jake Peralta

* Fantastic.
* Too dramatic? 

Charles Boyle

* No.

Jake Peralta

* Hi.

Mr. Terrino

* Why are we in the bathroom? 

Jake Peralta

* I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time.
* But first, I know what happened to your grandma.
* Nothing.

Mr. Terrino

* What are you talking about? 

Jake Peralta

* The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed.
* I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before.
* Five missing persons reports in five different states.
* Recognize this? 

Mr. Terrino

* What are you accusing us of? 

Jake Peralta

* Probably insurance fraud.
* Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice.
* Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom.
* It's because you're full of crap.

Charles Boyle

* Blammo! Jake hammer strikes again.

Jake Peralta

* Jake hammer strikes again.

Captain Ray Holt

* Detectives.
* I see we got eight recruits for the Junior Police Program.
* Outstanding.

Amy Santiago

* Thank you, sir.
* But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina.
* She's the one that got through to the kids.

Gina Linetti

* Yes, I am amazing.
* And I only ask for one thing in repayment.
* A 600% raise.

Captain Ray Holt

* Or, I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing.
* I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good the job.

Gina Linetti

* No, I have no talents.

Captain Ray Holt

* You start Monday.

Gina Linetti

* Ugh.
* Constantly getting Holt's approval is the worst.

Amy Santiago

* Yes.
* I can only imagine.

Jake Peralta

* Well, the curse is over.
* The slump is done.
* Jake is back.
* Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Permission denied.

Jake Peralta

* Too late.
* Ah, that was a good one.

Captain Ray Holt

* So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh? 

Jake Peralta

* Ah, maybe.
* All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases.
* And I now see that that was your plan all along.
* And that you're capable of smiling.

Captain Ray Holt

* All talented detectives have their ups and downs, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* So you think I'm talented.
* You said it.
* No takebacks.

Captain Ray Holt

* You know why Boyle doesn't slump? 

Jake Peralta

* Because his whole life is a slump? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Because he doesn't let adversity get him down.
* He keeps grinding.
* If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again.
* You need to stay out of your own head.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.
* But, sir, I don't get it.
* If that was your plan, why bother with Smitty and the rabbit's foot? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Well, there's a very good reason for that.
* I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh... messing with you.

Jake Peralta

* Oh I see what's going on here.
* We're becoming homies (homie is short for homeboy or homegirl, i.e. a close friend).
* Office Christmas card candidate, right here! Me and Holt are homies! 

Charles Boyle

* Hey, sarge.
* I assembled the castle for you.
* Here it is.

Terry Jeffords

* Oh, my God.
* What happened to all the princess flourishes? 

Charles Boyle

* Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station.
* You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take tenty little fingers.
* Did I ever tell you I had to wear woman's wedding ring?

Terry Jeffords

* Thank you, Boyle. I really appreciated it.

Charles Boyle

* You're a good dad. Don't push so much pressure on yourself.
* Oh, check this out. Working siren. (ringing nonstop)
* I will fix that. I will fix that.

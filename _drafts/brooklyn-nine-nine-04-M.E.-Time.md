Amy Santiago

* I'm so glad we could finally do this (指 date). 

A Man

* I know, Kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct.

Amy Santiago

* Yeah.
* (Phone rings) Speaking of, this is work.
* Sorry.
* What's up, Peralta? 

Jake Peralta

* Captain called.
* He needs everybody back.
* There's a lead on the Nightingale strangler.
* We're looking for a white male, brown hair, small scar on his right cheek (exactly the man Amy is dating with).

Amy Santiago

* Okay.

Jake Peralta

* His M.O. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van.
* It's pretty gnarly ['nɑrli] (US slang, dangerous).
* Last seen wearing a salmon (就是生鱼片的颜色) shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce ['letɪs] (莴苣) in his mouth.

Amy Santiago

* Okay.
* Where are you? 

Jake Peralta

* (walk close; speak in phone) Apparently has the world's smallest penis and doesn't know how to use it. 
* (off the phone; to the man) Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss.

Amy Santiago

* That's not true.
* What are you doing here? 

Jake Peralta

* I'm here on a date.
* Who is now... leaving. (looking at a beatiful lady leaving)  
* Worth it. (意思是我玩够了)  
* Have a great night. (running away)  

The Man

* Your boss seems really nice.

Amy Santiago

* He's not my boss.

Jake Peralta

* Yes, I am! (shout back)  

(morning in the PD; briefing)  
Jake Peralta

* And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead. (51-50)  
* Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week? 

Amy Santiago

* We heard.

Jake Peralta

* Really? How? 

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Five felonies in one week! Light 'em up, Boyle. (cola spray out to the ceiling; Cheers and applause)  

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* That's the sweet taste of triumph ['traɪʌmf].

Rosa Diaz

* You should shower more.

Jake Peralta

* Yep.

Terry Jeffords

* Updates on open cases.

Charles Boyle

* I just got a DOA on Bessimer Street.

Terry Jeffords

* You're the primary, you're in charge.
* Take Diaz and Peralta.

Charles Boyle

* Yes.
* My fantasy threesome. (stared by both)  
* Of cops on a case.

Captain Ray Holt

* Detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due.
* I want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow.
* Scully, you can just write "I didn't close any" on a piece of paper.

Scully

* You got it.

Amy Santiago

* I already got my paperwork in, Captain.

Captain Ray Holt

* Then I guess this little reminder isn't for you.

Jake Peralta

* (low voice) Wow, looks like he hates you even more than me.

Amy Santiago

* No, he doesn't.
* We have a good relationship.
* We're on the same page.

Captain Ray Holt

* Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago? 

Amy Santiago

* No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was the one that was talking.

Jake Peralta

* God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever.

Amy Santiago

* Joke's on you (翻译成 "傻了吧爷会飞" 真是太合适了).
* I skipped fourth grade.

Captain Ray Holt

* (harshly) Santiago, anything else? 

Amy Santiago

* No.

Captain Ray Holt

* No? 

Amy Santiago

* Uh-uh.

Captain Ray Holt

* Dismissed.

Amy Santiago

* Hey, Boyle.
* I know you haven't had Peralta as a secondary in a while.
* Be careful.
* It can be rough.

Jake Peralta

* Hey, saboteur [,sæbə'tjʊr], that's not true.
* I happen to be a very good secondary.

(recall starts)  
Amy Santiago

* (interrogating) So you were just 'borrowing' those cars?

Jake Peralta

* (outside interrogation room; yelling) Ask about his bank account.
* Ask about his bank account! 
* Ask him about his bank... (break the window accidentally) ...account. 
* You should ask him about his bank account.
* Captain, Santiago broke the glass. (walk away)  

(recall ends)  

Amy Santiago

* You can't give up control, you're terrible at taking your primary's orders, you just do whatever you want.
* I could go on and on and on.

Jake Peralta

* (It) Is something no lover of yours has ever said.

Charles Boyle

* Blammo.

Jake Peralta

* Look, I can be an amazing secondary and I'll prove it.

Charles Boyle

* I know you will, Jake-in-the-box.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, don't ever call me that again.
* I'm driving.
* We should leave now.
* Carry my bag.
* But... you should pick the music, primary.

(in the car)  
Charles Boyle

* (singing an old song Consider Yourself) *Consider yourself part of the furniture / There isn't a lot to spare / Who cares / Whatever we've got we share*

(back in PD; Captain is watching a picture of him on the wall)  
Amy Santiago

* It's a great picture, sir.

Captain Ray Holt

* I hate it.

Amy Santiago

* Me too.
* (Cap take it off the wall and disposed)  
* So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case.
* Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick.
* How do you want me to proceed? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Figure it out, Santiago.
* It's your case.

Amy Santiago

* Yes.
* I will do that.
* Thank you.

Captain Ray Holt

* Are you bowing? 

Amy Santiago

* No.
* This is how I walk. (walk backward bowing; passing RD)  

Rosa Diaz

* What do you need, Quasimodo? I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta.

Amy Santiago

* Is there something wrong with the Captain? It seems like he's in a bad mood.

Rosa Diaz

* I don't know.
* Who can tell? 

(recall starts)  

Rosa Diaz

* (come in the office with files) You all right, Captain? Tough weekend? 

Captain Ray Holt

* I went to Barbados with my husband.
* We wove (weave-wove-woven, 编织) hats out of Palm fronds [frɔnd] (a large leaf usually with many divisions, 比如棕榈树的叶子) and swam with the stingrays ['stɪŋreɪ] (黄貂鱼).
* I've never been happier.

(recall ends)  

Rosa Diaz

* Guy's impossible to read.
* Don't even try.

Captain Ray Holt

* (speaking beside on the phone) That is, without question, the funniest story I've ever heard. (no facial expression)  
* (Amy saw and understood)  

Jake Peralta

* (at crime scene) Wow.
* This guy must have weighed 500 pounds.
* I think we have an idea what killed him.
* Spoiler alert: It was not starvation.

Jake Peralta & Charles Boyle

* (to the cop first arrived) What do we got? 

Jake Peralta

* Sorry, sorry.
* You're the primary, you're in charge.

The Cop

* Frank Patterson.
* 58 years old. Married. No children.
* Wife found him this morning and called it in.

Charles Boyle

* Any signs of forced entry or a struggle? 

The Cop

* No.

Jake Peralta

* You sure about that? Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic (史诗的) struggle with his stomach.

The Cop

* (Laughs) 

Rosa Diaz

* What are you thinking, Boyle? 

Charles Boyle

* All ri.... 

Jake Peralta

* I'm calling (saying) natural causes.
* We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator [di:ˈfɪbrɪleɪtə(r)] (除颤器).
* And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing (branch) of Brooklyn Methodist (布鲁克林卫理公会心脏科).
* This case is open and shut.
* Just like his mouth was, constantly.
* That was my last fat joke.
* Okay? (Boyle failed to interrupt) 
* Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom.
* Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom.
* I'll take the kitchen.

Charles Boyle

* (Rosa staring)  
* Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
* It's... it's so weird.
* He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it.
* It's weird.

Amy Santiago

* Hey, sergeant.
* You know how you're really good at doodling? 

Terry Jeffords

* I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult.
* You a big fan of Picasso's doodles? 

Amy Santiago

* Sorry.
* Can you please draw a perp for me? The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away.
* He's in a bad mood.

Terry Jeffords

* Is he? I can never read him.

(recall starts)  
Terry Jeffords

* You look chipper (cheerful and lively), Captain.
* You have a fun weekend? 

Captain Ray Holt

* There was a small fire in my home.
* I lost many photo albums of treasured memories.
* I'm devastated ['devəsteɪt] (使...崩坏).

(recall ends)  
Amy Santiago

* I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him.
* Can you help me out? 
* (TJ nods) Great.
* Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords? 

A Lady

* Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo...

Terry Jeffords

* Wait, wait, wait.
* Slow down.
* Let's start with the eyes.
* Were they desperate? Lonely? Did they betray heartache? 

The Lady

* They were brown.

Terry Jeffords

* (slap the desk) Do you even want your purse back? 
* (the lady gets a little scared)  

Rosa Diaz

* So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze ['bʊldəʊz] Charles.
* Is that your idea of being a good secondary? 

Jake Peralta

* First off, I've told four.
* And second, I'm helping.
* I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge (refrigerator), but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth.
* Five fat jokes.
* (another policeman walk by, laughing) Thanks, Arnie.
* [Laughs] See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great.

Rosa Diaz

* Arnie, shut up.
* Jake, for once, just hang back and let Boyle do his job.

Jake Peralta

* [Groans] Fine.
* Unless I get a direct order from Boyle, I will stand here motionless like a wise, old oak tree. (mimicing)  

Rosa Diaz

* You look like an idiot.

Charles Boyle

* I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson.
* Can you talk about what happened after breakfast? 

Mrs. Patterson

* I took the dog for a walk.
* When I came back, he was dead.
* I'm just in shock.
* We were going on a cruise together next week.
* He had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package.

Charles Boyle

* I'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.

Jake Peralta

* Motion reactivated.
* (get down to the coroner just arrived) Hey.
* Detective Jake Peralta.

Dr. Rossi

* Dr. Rossi.
* I'm the new medical examiner.
* Don't let me get in your way.
* I'm sure you have a lot to do.

Jake Peralta

* Actually, I've been given a direct order to do nothing. 
* So, what brings you here? 

* Oh. (fall on the plastic cover of the body) 
* Okay. All right.
* Sorry. Sorry.

Dr. Rossi

* You all right? 

Jake Peralta

* What's up? (flirting tone) 

(back to PD)  
Captain Ray Holt

* How's the Patterson case looking? 

Charles Boyle

* It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy ['ɔːtɒpsɪ] results tomorrow.
* Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E. (medical examiner)  
* My man is all over it.

(dating)  
Dr. Rossi

* I'm really glad you could sneak away from your case.

Jake Peralta

* Well, it's technically not really my case, but on the plus (positive) side, I have all the time in the world.

Dr. Rossi

* Oh.

Jake Peralta

* To you. (toasting)  
* And to the ginormous [dʒaɪˈnɔ:məs] (gigantic + enormous [iˈnɔ:məs]), dead fat man who brought us together.

Dr. Rossi

* [Laughs] 

(back to PD)  
Charles Boyle

* Hey, Jake.
* Have you heard anything from the M.E.? She hasn't sent the autopsy report.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, that's strange.
* Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy? That's definitely what happened.

Charles Boyle

* Okay, just let me know when she calls.

Jake Peralta

* You got it.
* (stand up to RD and AS)  
* [Clears throat] Hey, can I ask you guys something? Can you keep a secret? 

Rosa Diaz

* Do you know anything about my life? 

Jake Peralta

* No, I do not. Good point.
* Okay, so you know the new medical examiner? I kinda had sex with her last night.

Amy Santiago

* What? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to.
* Sex is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other.

Rosa Diaz

* He's right, Santiago.
* Do you not know that? 

Amy Santiago

* I meant, what were you thinking? She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles.

Jake Peralta

* The guy died of natural causes.
* What's the big deal? 
* Anyways, back to last night.
* As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy.

(recall starts)  
Dr. Rossi

* Wait.
* Close your eyes.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, okay.

Dr. Rossi

* (put an ice cube onto JP's lips)  

Jake Peralta

* [Yelps] 

Dr. Rossi

* Shh.
* Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Jake Peralta

* What are you doing? 

Dr. Rossi

* I like 'em cold.

Jake Peralta

* Okay... 

(recall ends)  
Rosa Diaz

* Not that weird.

Jake Peralta

* Cold? Like a dead guy? 

Amy Santiago

* You're reading into that. (过度解析)  

Jake Peralta

* Am I? 

(recall starts)  
Dr. Rossi

* You have a really nice chest.

Jake Peralta

* Thank you.

Dr. Rossi

* I'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.

Jake Peralta

* Okay. 

Dr. Rossi

* I wonder how much your appendix (阑尾) weighs.
* [Gasps] Oh.
* It's inflamed.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* Wait, that's bad, right?

Dr. Rossi

* Yeah, it is.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, no.

(recall ends)  
Amy Santiago

* Ew! Please tell me you ran out of there.

Jake Peralta

* No.
* For some reason I kinda started getting into it.

(recall starts)  
Dr. Rossi

* Oh, what do we have here? 

Jake Peralta

* A 34-year-old Caucasian [kɔːˈkeɪzɪən] male who is dead.
* Very dead.

Dr. Rossi

* Mmm.
* Cause of death? 

Jake Peralta

* Initial assessment: Blunt force trauma.

Dr. Rossi

* But what do I find when I probe a little farther? 

Jake Peralta

* Bruising around the neck.
* And ocean water in the lungs.

Dr. Rossi

* Ooh, how long have you been dead, body? 

Jake Peralta

* Four days.

Dr. Rossi

* Gross.
* Bloating.
* Odors.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, uh, 24 hours.

Dr. Rossi

* Perfect.

Jake Peralta

* Here we go.

(recall ends)  
Amy Santiago

* Stop, stop, stop! Weird, weird, weird! 

Rosa Diaz

* Rosa, what's your call? (你怎么看?) Weird or sexy? 

Rosa Diaz

* Weird.

Jake Peralta

* I knew it!
* But also kinda sexy? 

Rosa Diaz

* No.
* Weird.
* But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork? 

Amy Santiago

* Told you.
* Worst secondary in the unit.

Jake Peralta

* What do you guys want from me? 
* You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary.
* I blow off work to have sex with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary.
* I can't win.

Charles Boyle

* (come up) What are you guys talking about? 

Jake Peralta

* Um, just weird sex stuff that has nothing to do with work.

Charles Boyle

* I once had sex on a futon ['fu:tɒn].
* And it was in couch mode.
* (weird facial expression on the other 3)  

Amy Santiago

* (the perp sketch) Sarge, all of these are fine.
* How much longer are you gonna work on this? 

Terry Jeffords

* It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear.
* You can't put a clock on art. (Amy stares back)  
* Ten minutes.

Amy Santiago

* Great.
* Let's catch this guy so we can give Holt some good news.
* I wanna cheer him up.

Scully

* Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood? I mean, it's impossible to read that guy.

(recall starts)  
Captain Ray Holt

* This is the most incompetent [ˈkɒmpɪtənt], worthless report I have ever read in my life! Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement! 

(recall ends)  

Scully

* It's like, "what's that guy thinking?" You know? 

Amy Santiago

* I can read him.
* And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me.
* He and I are exactly the same, except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight.

Scully

* Captain Holt's not gay.
* (stared by the 2) Captain Holt's gay? 

Amy Santiago

* Seriously, man, just retire.

Captain Ray Holt

* Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA? 

Charles Boyle

* Still waiting on the autopsy report.
* Supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing.

Captain Ray Holt

* This is unacceptable.
* I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.

Jake Peralta

* Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah.
* That's not necessary, sir.
* For the record, I think it's natural causes anyway, but I'm also the secondary in this case.
* It's my responsibility, so I will head on down there and pick up the report.

Captain Ray Holt

* Good.
* But don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.

Jake Peralta

* Right, I don't know...

Captain Ray Holt

* Bup-bup-bup-bup. Bup-bup-bup. (just stop JP's word)  
* Just go.

Jake Peralta

* Yep, I am going to regret teaching him that one.

Charles Boyle

* Rosa, can I show you something? 

Rosa Diaz

* What's up? 

Charles Boyle

* Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked.
* Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die.

Rosa Diaz

* Huh, nice find, Boyle.

Charles Boyle

* This could be a murder.
* Where's that autopsy? Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago. He still hasn't got back to me.

Rosa Diaz

* Jake went to get the autopsy report? 

Charles Boyle

* I know.
* Isn't he the best? I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary.
* I wanna get him something nice.
* Does he come across more as a Pinot (加州葡萄品种, 供酿造酒用) guy or more of a Shiraz (法国隆河谷北部葡萄品种)? 

Rosa Diaz

* You know what? We better go down there.
* See what's holding him up.

Charles Boyle

* Good call.

(at morgue)  
Dr. Rossi

* Detectives.
* [Clears throat] Hello.

Rosa Diaz

* Shirt's buttoned wrong.

Dr. Rossi

* Huh. So it is. (embarrassed)  
* Well, how can I help you? 

Charles Boyle

* Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report.

Dr. Rossi

* Hmm.

Charles Boyle

* Is Detective Peralta here? 

Dr. Rossi

* I haven't seen him.
* Thanks for coming by.

[Coughing]
Rosa Diaz

* Hold on.
* Found him.

Jake Peralta

* Ah, thank goodness you're here.
* I am so lost.
* Do you know where the vending machines are? 

Jake Peralta

* Look, it's not what it seems like.

Rosa Diaz

* Yes, it is.

Jake Peralta

* Yes, it is.
* Here's what happened.
* I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are.
* Now if you'll excuse me...

Rosa Diaz

* Cut the crap, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Look, I'm sorry I slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes.

Charles Boyle

* Not anymore.
* We think it could be a murder.

Jake Peralta

* Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded? 

Rosa Diaz

* Murder murder.
* We need the autopsy to be sure.

Dr. Rossi

* I have not gotten to that yet.

Charles Boyle

* You guys have been down here for two hours.
* What, did you have sex 40 times? 

Jake Peralta

* 40 times?
* No, Charles, like... 
* Look, I'm sorry.
* We didn't know it was a homicide.

Charles Boyle

* Well, it shouldn't matter.
* I'm your primary and I asked you to do something.
* So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you.

Jake Peralta

* It's more than okay.
* It's okay times two.
* Now, Dr. Rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now? 

Dr. Rossi

* Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up.

Jake Peralta

* Guilty. (my fault) (trying to joke but in vain)  
* Okay, fine.
* I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary.
* How gross could it be? 

Dr. Rossi

* Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity (腔; 洞) for me.

Jake Peralta

* Oh. Wow.
* Okay, I can do that.
* It's no big deal.
* Just like holding open some slimy ['slaɪmɪ] (slime 粘液) elevator doors, for a family of aliens. Oh, my God.

Dr. Rossi

* Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.
* Oh, will you look at that stomach lining (内衬; 内层粘膜)? God, that is just a beaut.

Jake Peralta

* Ugh.

Dr. Rossi

* All right.
* I'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand... 
* [JP Groans] Yep, get it down there.
* [JP Groans] Get it down there. Get it on in.
* [JP Groans] There you go.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, that is so big. (holding an organ in hand)  

(back to PD)  
Captain Ray Holt

* Caught him? (the perp sketch case)  

Amy Santiago

* Yes, sir.
* He was easy to pick up.
* He looked just like the sergeant's sketch.

Scully 

* You could be a professional artist, boss.
* Like (the ones) on the boardwalk.

Terry Jeffords

* You think I should draw caricatures ['kærɪkətʃʊɚ] (a drawing that makes someone look funny or foolish because some part of the person's appearance is exaggerated)? That's garbage art! I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards! 

Scully

* I'm saying you could. You're that good. (leave)  

Amy Santiago

* Captain, the credit really goes to sergeant Jeffords.
* Without his refined artistic skills... 

Captain Ray Holt

* Finish the paperwork by noon.
* I want it included in the crime stats.

The Perp

* I gotta say, I always hate how I look in pictures, but that is so flattering.
* Also, I'm innocent.
* You got the wrong guy.

Terry Jeffords

* Shut up.

Amy Santiago

* Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me.

Terry Jeffords

* What? 

Amy Santiago

* (pick up the disposed picture of Captain) 
* (TJ seems unwilling) It'll cheer the Captain up.
* He'll be over the moon.
* He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly.

Terry Jeffords

* This is a lot of pressure.
* If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right.
* Scully—— 

Scully

* Yep.

Terry Jeffords

* Get me my oils (油彩).

Scully

* Paint or massage? (TJ got pissed off) I'll get both.

Dr. Rossi

* You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen.
* It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli [,rævɪ'əʊlɪ].
* Sure you want me to keep digging? 

Jake Peralta

* Unfortunately, yes.
* If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder.

Dr. Rossi

* Okay.
* Here we go.
* Oh. Wanna see something cool? 

Jake Peralta

* No.

Dr. Rossi

* Here it is.
* That's what I'm talking about.
* [Gasps] Listen.
* Goosh.
* Mm-hmm.
* You know what that was? That was the air releasing from the large intestine.
* [Sighs] In the biz (slang, business), we call that "the death bubble". It's pretty cool.
* Here, you wanna hold it? 

Jake Peralta

* No! 

Amy Santiago

* (comes into the office) Knock knock.

Captain Ray Holt

* You can knock with your hands.
* Saying it is ridiculous.

Amy Santiago

* Okay.
* Well, I know you're having a bad day...(stared by Cap) I think you're having a bad day.
* So, to cheer you up I had Terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated.

Captain Ray Holt

* I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious [,ɒsten'teɪʃəs] (showing off) to hang pictures of yourself, especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.

Amy Santiago

* Oh.

Captain Ray Holt

* But you would have me hang a baroque [bəˈrəʊk] (巴洛克) oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator.
* What? No ornate (rich in decorative detail) gold frame? Why am I not astride [əˈstraɪd] my noble steed, clad [clothe-clad-clad] in armor? 

Amy Santiago

* We could add a horse.

Captain Ray Holt

* You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher.

Amy Santiago

* Oh, I did.
* It's already in the system.

Captain Ray Holt

* Oh.

Amy Santiago

* Mm-hmm.

Captain Ray Holt

* Good.
* Thank you.
* Dismissed.

Dr. Rossi

* Here are the contents of his stomach.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, that's where they went.

Dr. Rossi

* And here's the really cool part.
* Get in here, look at the scarring (== scar) on this liver.
* Cause of death: Poison.
* Ingested.

Jake Peralta

* Boyle was right.
* All right, I'm gonna go tell him.

Dr. Rossi

* Yeah, you could.
* Or you could stay for a post-mortem ['mɔːtəm].

Jake Peralta

* Nope.
* Sorry.
* The spell has worn off.
* No more weird dead guy sex for me ever again.
* It's nothing personal, I just think sex is for the living.
* Isn't that right, buddy? Oh, my God, he has no eyes! Oh, that is terrifying.

Captain Ray Holt

* What now, Santiago? 

Amy Santiago

* I figured out why you've been so tense.
* You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.

Captain Ray Holt

* That's not your concern.

Amy Santiago

* I just checked the stats myself.
* Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here.
* They're exactly the same as last month.

Captain Ray Holt

* If this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring.

Amy Santiago

* Sir, I don't think you realize how good flat (无波动的) numbers are.
* I went back 12 years.
* A precinct's numbers almost always get worse under new leadership, but ours didn't.
* That's a win.
* It's just your first month.
* Morale is much higher, people are working harder, you're well on your way to earning a place on that wall.

Captain Ray Holt

* Thank you, Santiago.

Amy Santiago

* You know, we're birds of a feather (people having similar characters, backgrounds, interests, or beliefs), you and I.

Captain Ray Holt

* I hate cliches (cliché [ˈkliːʃeɪ]).

Amy Santiago

* Cliches are the worst.

Charles Boyle

* We know you killed your husband.
* That cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison.

Jake Peralta

* And for the record, the inside of his body, was very gross.

Charles Boyle

* (to JP) Noted.
* My only question is, why'd you do it? 

Mrs. Patterson

* Um, he drove me to it.
* He had affair after affair.
* He was a real Don Juan [,dɔn'hwɑ:n].

Jake Peralta

* Permission to make a fat joke? 

Charles Boyle

* Granted.

Jake Peralta

* Are you sure you didn't mean "Don Flan"? 
* Thanks.

Charles Boyle

* Nice.
* Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.

Rosa Diaz

* Sarge, that painting is tight.

Terry Jeffords

* It's terrible.
* The brushwork (用笔) is sloppy (马虎的).
* There's poor use of negative space (留白).
* I'm a fraud [frɔːd].

Captain Ray Holt

* Not at all.
* I'd like to take this home for my husband.
* He'll be glad you made me look so happy. (leave)  

Terry Jeffords

* I was trying to make him look serious.
* I still can't read him.

Rosa Diaz

* No one can.

Amy Santiago

* I can.
* He likes it.

(after work; in the bar)  
Rosa Diaz

* Nice job, Boyle.
* You nailed it.

Jake Peralta

* Here.
* Of course he did.
* He's a great primary.
* And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two.
* I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry.

Charles Boyle

* What a wonderful moment.

Jake Peralta

* I agree, it is a wonderful moment.

Charles Boyle

* What a wonderful moment.

Jake Peralta

* Rosa, do you agree? 

Rosa Diaz

* It's all right.
* It's all right.

Jake Peralta & Charles Boyle

* (sing) *Wonderful moment / Between two guys* 

Charles Boyle

* [phone vibrates] Oh. D.A. wants to set bail (保释金) for Patterson's wife.
* They need me to send them all the files.

Jake Peralta

* I'm the secondary.
* I'll go back there and do the busy work.
* You guys stay here and keep celebrating.

Rosa Diaz

* You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy sex? 

Jake Peralta

* [Laughs] We will never speak of that again.
* Never.
* Okay, bye.

Charles Boyle

* God.
* Crazy day, huh? 

Rosa Diaz

* I hate small talk.
* Let's drink in silence.

Charles Boyle

* Perfect.

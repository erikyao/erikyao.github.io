Jake Peralta

* Hey, you guys see the dude I brought in today? The drug dealer? 
* 81 years old. I think it's the oldest collar of my entire career.

Amy Santiago

* I once arrested a 96-year-old, for flashing (暴露狂).
* I was terrified he'd die in my backseat... or flash me.

Rosa Diaz

* My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20.

Scully

* What about two 50-year-old twins? Does that count as a 100-year-old? 

Amy Santiago

* No good.

Jake Peralta

* No.

Charles Boyle

* You talking oldest bags (old bag 指老女人，轻蔑口气)? 68. 

Rosa Diaz

* That's not that old.

Charles Boyle

* Yeah, but I was only 20.

Jake Peralta

* 20? Were you even a cop then? 

Charles Boyle

* No, man, it was before I got into the academy.

Rosa Diaz

* Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.

Amy Santiago

* Ew! 

Jake Peralta

* Oh...

Rosa Diaz

* No... yes, yes, I am.
* Yeah, oldest arrest... 68, like I said. 

Jake Peralta

* God, you had sex with a 68-year-old when you were in your 20s? 

Charles Boyle

* You know how it is.
* When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you...

Jake Peralta

* No, that is not an older woman.
* That's an old woman! That's someone's grandma! 

Charles Boyle

* She was, actually.
* That's how I met her.

Amy Santiago

* Oh!

Charles Boyle

* Went to college with her grandson Marvin.

Jake Peralta

* (laughing)  

Charles Boyle

* Don't... don't knock it till you tr... (try it 没说完)  
* She had a replacement hip with some serious (有种 "货真价实" "有点厉害" 的意思) torque [tɔːk].
* It was like having sex with a transformer.

Jake Peralta

* No.
* That is no one's fantasy.

(briefing)  
Terry Jeffords

* Peralta, where are we on the Lincoln place murder? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, like I told Captain Holt earlier this week, we are at the one-yard line.
* It's a football reference.

Terry Jeffords

* Yes, Jake.
* I played linebacker (中后卫) at Syracuse ['sirəkju:z].

Jake Peralta

* Really? 

Charles Boyle

* In High School, I played center field (棒球中外场) in the musical _Damn Yankees_.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, you don't want to brag about that.

Captain Ray Holt

* Peralta, you want to loop everyone in? 

Jake Peralta

* Ehh... 

Captain Ray Holt

* That was not a request.

Jake Peralta

* Fine.
* Wu... (getting up)  
* Get ready for some stuff on a screen.
* Meet Fred Gorman, prominent [ˈprɒmɪnənt] citizen, lawyer, corpse.
* Now meet his wife, Ann Hoert.
* She did not take his last name, but I believe she did take his life.

Charles Boyle

* Nice (rhyme).

Jake Peralta

* Thank you, Charles.
* Now, Hoert had means, motives, and opportunity.
* I just need to find the murder weapon.
* For some reason, the D.A. won't move forward with the arrest until we find the knife she used.

Captain Ray Holt

* Is that reason that they want to win the case? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes.

Captain Ray Holt

* Well, find it.
* The family's close to the mayor, and I'm catching heat from the higher-ups.
* I'm gonna ask you again.
* Do you need any resources or personnel? 

Jake Peralta

* No, sir, I've got it.

Captain Ray Holt

* Okay.
* Dismissed! Sergeant Jeffords, my office.

Gina Linetti

* Uh-oh.
* He probably wants to talk to you about how your shirts aren't tight enough probably.

Amy Santiago

* Okay, how can we help? What do you need? 

Jake Peralta

* I need nothing.
* I'm about to solve this case, meet the mayor, and sell my life rights to Channing Tatum so he can play my less attractive brother in the ensuing [ɪn'sju:] film.

Rosa Diaz

* Come on, Peralta. Holt said to use the whole team.
* We all want this solved.

Jake Peralta

* I appreciate the offer, but I work best alone, except when it comes to sex.
* Actually, sometimes including sex.

Amy Santiago

* Will you just let us help? 

Jake Peralta

* Okay, fine.
* I will let one of you help me... Charles.

Charles Boyle

* Yeah! 

Jake Peralta

* And I am choosing Charles because he's the least likely to steal my thunder.

Charles Boyle

* I would never steal his thunder.
* I...I'd be afraid to borrow it.

Captain Ray Holt

* Terry, I'd like you to accompany me to a gun range.

Terry Jeffords

* You mean drive you there and wait outside, far away from the guns.

Captain Ray Holt

* I spent eight years in the public affairs office, so my tactical skills are a little rusty.
* I need some pointers.

Terry Jeffords

* Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident.

Captain Ray Holt

* The mannequin ['mænɪkɪn] (塑料人形模特) incident. I'm familiar.

Terry Jeffords

* Actually, there was an incident after that.

Captain Ray Holt

* Another incident? 

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* You got to cool it, man.
* I'm gonna get some candy.

(recall ends)  

Terry Jeffords

* Sir, I may not be the man for the job.

Captain Ray Holt

* You used to be the precinct's champion marksman.
* I only want to take pointers from the best.
* So I'll keep it low-key.
* We'll go after work to a private range.
* No cops, no pressure.

Gina Linetti

* Blam! Blam, blam! Gun range. (Terry was scared by Gina)  

Captain Ray Holt

* I told Gina she could join us.

Gina Linetti

* I want to get certified.
* There has been a ton of crime in my neighborhood, and the cops in my precinct are very bad.

Captain Ray Holt

* You live in our precinct.

Gina Linetti

* Yeah, I know.

Jake Peralta

* I know we've gone over this before, but I have to ask you again.
* Is there anywhere you can think of in that hallway where a knife could be hidden? 

The Doorman

* Well, since I've already told you, like, three times, no. Why don't I just record it? Then I don't have to say it again.
* (to the recorder) The hallway, like all other hallways, does not have a secret knife-hiding place.
* All right, you want to hear it again? 
* (from the recorder) Idea for a novel: A mild-mannered doorman gets bitten on the penis by a radioactive spider and becomes the world's greatest lover.

Jake Peralta

* No, don't stop it.
* I want to hear what happens.

The Doorman

* This is terrific.
* He saves the first lady, if you must know.

Jake Peralta

* Sounds compelling [kəm'pel].

(door duty; a naked old lady open the door)  

Charles Boyle

* Oh, boy.

The Old Lady

* Well, hello.
* I heard you guys were making the rounds again.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* This one's all you, tiger. (leave)  

Charles Boyle

* Come on! 

Jake Peralta

* (knock another door) Police! 
* (door open; a lady holding a baby) Hey, ma'am.

The Lady

* Thank God! Here, hold this. (pass the baby to Jake)  
* The lasagna's [lə'zænjə] (烤面条) burning.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.

The Lady

* Get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby! (Charles gets to the dog)  

Jake Peralta

* Oh.
* (phone ringing) Okay.
* Peralta.

Rosa Diaz

* Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk.

Jake Peralta

* Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.

Rosa Diaz

* The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back.
* They aren't from a knife.
* I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew ['kɔ:kskru:] (cork 软木塞).

Jake Peralta

* (baby crying) Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Rosa Diaz

* Don't shush [ʃʌʃ] me.
* I'm helping you.

Jake Peralta

* No, no, I'm holding a baby.
* That was actually very helpful, thank you.

Rosa Diaz

* Uh-oh. (Rosa saw someone)  
* You better get back here.
* Now.

(Jake back to PD)  
The Vulture

* Oh! Hello, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Oh... No, no, no! 

The Vulture

* (Jake pass by) I don't know why you're so upset, man.
* I'm the one who had to come to this backwater, stink hole.
* (Charles pass by) What's up, little man? 

Charles Boyle

* What's up? 

The Vulture

* Feeling sexy? Huh? 

Charles Boyle

* Yeah, I feel sexy.

The Vulture

* Yeah, you look sexy, man.

Charles Boyle

* You know I do.

The Vulture

* Watch out for that door. (Charles followed Jake into Captain's office)  
* (To Terry) Yo, how much you bench (卧推), seriously? 

(in the office)  
Jake Peralta

* Captain, please, please, pretty please do not let him take over my case.

Captain Ray Holt

* Major Crimes is stepping in.
* Nothing I can do.
* You're off the case.

Jake Peralta

* I can't believe you're just rolling over (to give in) and giving my murder away to the vulture.

Charles Boyle

* We call him the vulture because he swoops [swu:p] in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes, Boyle, I put that together, from context.
* First of all, major crimes has jurisdiction [ˌdʒʊərɪsˈdɪkʃn] (司法权) over any and all cases they want to take.
* But more importantly, you're the one who insisted on working alone.
* I told you for weeks to use the squad, and you refused.

Jake Peralta

* I used them.
* I mean, Rosa's the one who figured out the corkscrew.
* And Charles caught a dog.

Captain Ray Holt

* Oh, congratulations, Detective Boyle.
* (to Jake) You should've involved him sooner.
* Turn over your files to Detective Pembroke.

Jake Peralta

* Sir, call him the vulture.
* Giving him a name makes him human.

Captain Ray Holt

* Turn over the files.

Jake Peralta

* Fine.
* But in protest, I'm walking over there extremely slowly.
* (slowly; Charles steps back) Thank you.
* God! This is so boring! 

Captain Ray Holt

* For both of us.

The Vulture

* You know, before I solve this case, I'd like to thank you for doing all the super-easy work, you know, the real Nancy-Drew-level (《少女妙探》主人公) stuff.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, yeah? Did Nancy drew solve a lot of murders? 

Charles Boyle

* Yeah, she did... _Murder on Ice_, _Recipe for Murder_.
* Nancy was a wonderful Detective.
* I wanted to be her when I grew up.

Jake Peralta

* Thanks, Charles.
* That's helpful.

The Vulture

* Hey! Should we take odds on how fast I'll solve this case?

Jake Peralta

* Nope.

The Vulture

* I mean, what was it with Diaz's last "impossible" extortion [ɪk'stɔ:ʃn] (敲诈勒索) case? What was it, six hours? 

Rosa Diaz

* That's because it was 98% solved.

The Vulture

* The last 2% is the hardest to get.
* That's why they leave it in the milk. (指牛奶含脂量 2%)  

Jake Peralta

* What? 

The Vulture

* Oh! Wow! Looking good, Santiago.
* You foxy ma.

Amy Santiago

* Go rot in hell.
* (to Jake) This is your fault.

The Vulture

* Thanks, champ(ion). (Jake passes the files)  
* Good effort.
* I got it from here. (I'll investigate based on your work)  
* And, hey, you feel free to call me anytime you need me to come down here and help powder that big white ass of yours. (leave)  

Jake Peralta

* Well, that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

(after work; at a bar)  
Jake Peralta

* I hate the vulture so much! 

Rosa Diaz

* Me too.
* But he's kind of hot.
* What? You can hate people and still think they're hot.
* Case in point, Manuel Noriega (前巴拿马军事独裁者).

Jake Peralta

* You know what? I'm with you on this.
* Tonya Harding (花滑运动员，有丑闻).

Rosa Diaz

* Yeah, she's thick.

Jake Peralta

* Right? 

Amy Santiago

* Always classy, Jake.

Jake Peralta

* Mm-hmm.

Rosa Diaz

* Sorry you got vultured.
* Happens to the best of us.

(recall starts)  
Rosa Diaz

* On my count.
* One, two... 

The Vulture

* (from behind) Three! I got it from here! 
* (break in) Yeah! Get up! Get up! Turn around! 

Amy Santiago

* You have the right to remain silent.
* Anything you say... 

The Vulture

* ...can and will be used against you in a court of law.
* Thanks, guys, I got it from here.

Salesgirl

* Skim white chocolate macchiato [,mækɪ'ɑːtəʊ] for Charles.

The Vulture

* I got it from here.

Charles Boyle

* I used a gift card for that! 

(recall ends)  
Jake Peralta

* God, I just I want to get back at him so bad! I wish I could throw his cell phone in the toilet or slash his tires... I don't know.

Rosa Diaz

* Or slash his gorgeous throat.

Charles Boyle

* I cannot figure you out.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, I'm buying everyone drinks as long as we're here thinking of a revenge plan.
* Best idea gets 50 bucks.
* Throw 'em on out.

Charles Boyle

* What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead? Like, they died of cancer.

Jake Peralta

* Charles, that is so dark.
* I'm putting it down.

(at gun range)  
Captain Ray Holt

* So my stance [stæns] feels good, but I'm still not hitting center.

Terry Jeffords

* All right.
* Back your left foot up a hair (a little).

Gina Linetti

* Like this? Mm, mm, mm! 

Terry Jeffords

* No! Gina! We've been over this.

Gina Linetti

* Well, show me! Like, wrap your thick, muscular arms around me and...

Terry Jeffords

* All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward.

Gina Linetti

* Hold on, my nose itches.

Terry Jeffords

* Gina! 

Captain Ray Holt

* When I lock my shooting arm, the other hand feels unstable.
* Now, what stance am I supposed to be doing, weaver or isosceles [aɪ'sɒsɪliːz]? 

Gina Linetti

* You guys did stances? Like... I'll be like.

Captain Ray Holt

* Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina.

Terry Jeffords

* Listen, uh...
* Hey, all right, all right! Look, hey, both you, just watch. (grasp the gun and shoot)  

Gina Linetti

* That's eight! He did it! 

Captain Ray Holt

* That was only seven.

Terry Jeffords

* Why are you counting my shots? Are you trying to have me recertified? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes.
* If you make eight of ten shots, I can sign off on you carrying a gun again.
* Gina's here as an official witness, and I thought it'd be easier for you in a no-pressure environment.

Terry Jeffords

* I can't believe you tricked me! 

Captain Ray Holt

* You're too good a cop to be shackled ['ʃækl] (镣铐) to a desk.
* You only have one hit until you get recertified.
* So deep breath, huh? Take the final shot.

Terry Jeffords

* (speak to himself) Don't overthink it.
* Just relax and breathe.
* Bring air into your lungs, like you've done your whole life.
* Oh, my God.
* Guys! How do you breathe? I forgot how to breathe! Is it two in, one out? 

Charles Boyle

* What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* Here's what we're up to.
* Steal his kidney, burn down his house, replace his aloe ['æləʊ] (芦荟) tissues with regular tissues.
* Thank you, Charles.

Charles Boyle

* You're welcome.

Jake Peralta

* Leave a dead cat in his cedar ['siːdə] (雪松) closet.
* Note: He would have to own a cedar closet.

Rosa Diaz

* He seems like he would.

Jake Peralta

* Sneak into his apartment and burn popcorn in the microwave.
* Thank you, Charles.
* Uh, Scully asked for mashed (mash, 捣碎) potatoes (土豆泥), so I wrote that down.
* Well, I hate to say it, but I think, by default, Charles' motorcycle idea is the winner.

Charles Boyle

* Yeah! Winning by default.

Jake Peralta

* Let's get into it.
* Anybody know where the vulture lives? 

Rosa Diaz

* On third, right near here.

Charles Boyle

* How do you know that? 

Jake Peralta

* Chug [tʃʌɡ] (一口干) 'em, boys.
* We're rolling! 

Charles Boyle

* (wrapped the motorbike) Yes! Take that, vulture! 

Jake Peralta

* All right, give me your hair dryer.

Rosa & Amy

* What? 

Amy Santiago

* What are you talking about? 

Jake Peralta

* Don't you carry one in your purse? 

Amy Santiago

* Have you ever met a human woman? 

Scully

* There's a drugstore four blocks away. I'm on it.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, no.
* Scully traveling four blocks? That could take weeks.

Scully

* (stop to take a rest; just steps away) Hoo! 

(gun range)  
Captain Ray Holt

* Take the shot, sergeant.

Terry Jeffords

* I just need a second.

Captain Ray Holt

* You've had 18 minutes of seconds.

Gina Linetti

* (phone ringing) Gina's authentic [ɔ:ˈθentɪk] stolen police badges.
* How can I help? 

Jake Peralta

* Hey, it's Peralta.

Gina Linetti

* Oh, hey, Jake.

Jake Peralta

* Hey, do you carry a hair dryer in your purse? 

Gina Linetti

* Of course. I'm not an animal.

Jake Peralta

* (look to Amy) Great.
* I need you to bring it to the vulture's apartment.

Gina Linetti

* There's someone named "the vulture"? 
* Tell Rosa. She'd be into that.

Charles Boyle

* Come on! 

Captain Ray Holt

* (take the phone from Gina) Peralta, why are you asking Gina about Detective Pembroke? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, Captain, hello.
* Uh, we are preparing him a gift basket of sorts.

Captain Ray Holt

* Look, I understand that you're upset.
* But if you want to keep this from happening again, I suggest that you pull your team together and solve these cases before Major Crimes can step in.
* Am I clear? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes, sir.
* That is definitely clear.
* Thank you, sir.

Amy Santiago

* You should be frowning.
* (to Charles) Why is Jake smi... Why are you smiling? 

Jake Peralta

* Because the Captain just gave us the perfect revenge plan.
* We team up and solve this case right now! 

Amy Santiago

* That is not what he meant.

Jake Peralta

* Think about it, Amy.
* We go back to the scene of the crime, find the murder weapon, and out-vulture the vulture! No one gets in trouble if we crack the case.

Amy Santiago

* Okay, screw it.
* I'm in.

Jake Peralta

* Yes! That's right! 
* All right. We're angry. We're getting revenge. We're a little bit tipsy ['tɪpsɪ] (slightly drunk). We should not be driving. We're taking the bus.

Charles Boyle

* I love the bus! 

(on the bus)  
Jake Peralta

* So the waitress heard the couple arguing at dinner.
* Apparently he was having an affair, and it was not the first time.
* Two years ago, she caught him with a dog walker who was walking his dog (指捉奸), if you know what I mean.

Amy Santiago

* I do.

Jake Peralta

* Right? 

Amy Santiago

* Yes, I got it.

Jake Peralta

* Sex times.

Amy Santiago

* Mm-hmm.

Jake Peralta

* Anyways, we know it's the wife.

Amy Santiago

* You're real talkative now that you want our help.

Jake Peralta

* All right, it is possible that I should've brought you guys in sooner.
* But I just get so excited, wrapped up in wanting to solve stuff, you know? 

Amy Santiago

* I get it.
* You want to be the best.
* We all do.
* You just don't have to be such a butthead about it.
* What? 

Jake Peralta

* I just can't believe you would call me a butthead.

Amy Santiago

* Shut up.

Jake Peralta

* That's so harsh.

Rosa Diaz

* (come to sit beside Charles) Hitchcock farts nonstop.

Captain Ray Holt

* Still waiting, sergeant.

Terry Jeffords

* It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine.
* It's just freaking me out.

Captain Ray Holt

* You have a friend, who's just a silhouette [,sɪlʊ'et]? 

Terry Jeffords

* Yes.
* Let's all just count to a million.
* One, two, three, four, five, six... 

Terry Jeffords

* (minutes later) So then Iceman says, "you can be my wingman any day". And then Maverick says... 

Captain Ray Holt

* I've seen the film (《壮志凌云》), sergeant.

Gina Linetti

* I haven't.
* What happens next? Goose comes back, right? He's not really dead.

Terry Jeffords

* Goose is gone.

Gina Linetti

* No! 

Terry Jeffords

* I know! 

(crime scene)  
Jake Peralta

* All right, here's how it went down.
* 9:45, a man screams.
* 90 seconds later, wife goes down to the doorman, says a guy murdered her husband and then ran off.
* We know she's lying.
* We've just got to find the corkscrew to make our case airtight.
* I say we role-play, see if something sparks.

(role play) 
Jake Peralta

* Darling, thank you for a lovely dinner.
* Perhaps we should have one more drink before bed.

Charles Boyle

* Don't you "darling" me, you philanderer [fɪ'lændərɚ].

Jake Peralta

* No, you're the husband.
* The husband had the affair.

Charles Boyle

* I'm always the victim.
* I don't want to be the victim.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, Charles is the door.

Charles Boyle

* No.
* I'll be the victim.
* Don't make me a door again.

Jake Peralta

* Great.
* Okay, so... wife goes into the drawer.
* Gets the corkscrew.
* Stab, stab, stab.
* What did she do with the corkscrew? 

Rosa Diaz

* She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.

Jake Peralta

* No, we checked the trash, like, ten times.
* We would've seen a bloody corkscrew.
* All right, Hitchcock, you're up.

(Hitchcock plays the wife; stabbed Charles)  
Hitchcock

* The body.
* The corkscrew's still in the body.

Jake Peralta

* No, you're terrible at this.
* Go sit down.
* You're up, Diaz.

Rosa Diaz

* Stab! Then I... toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car.

Jake Peralta

* Security cam showed no one driving by at that time and nothing on the street.

Amy Santiago

* Okay, I want in.
* But I only want to stab you.

Jake Peralta

* Fine.
* Charles, door.

Charles Boyle

* Right.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, uh, sweetheart.

Amy Santiago

* Time to die.

Jake Peralta

* That seems a little harsh.

Amy Santiago

* (turn around and see the refrigerator) What if it was a magnetic corkscrew? If the corkscrew was on a magnet... 

Jake Peralta

* It's stuck halfway down the inside of the trash chute.
* I figured it out first! 

Charles Boyle

* Wow! (all rushing to the trash chute)  

Hitchcock

* What's happening? 

Jake Peralta

* You have a ten-pound flashlight in your purse, but not a hair dryer? 

Amy Santiago

* I can't see far enough down.

Jake Peralta

* Someone's gonna have to go down in there.
* Someone with narrow shoulders.

Charles Boyle

* No! I have broad shoulders.
* I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders.
* God! 

Jake Peralta

* See anything? 

Charles Boyle

* A little lower.

Two Cops

* Freeze! Hands in the air! 

Charles Boyle

* (released down) Ahh! 

Jake Peralta

* We're cops.

Charles Boyle

* Broad shoulders! Stuck! Told you. Broad shoulders.

Captain Ray Holt

* (end the conversation on the phone) Apparently, our Detective squad has gotten drunk, compromised ['kɒmprəmaɪz] the crime scene, and an officer has gotten stuck in a trash chute.
* I need you to lead this squad, Terry.
* And I mean really lead it.
* I hope you take the shot.

(back to PD)  
The Vulture

* What kind of precinct are you running here? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Would you like to sit down, Detective? You seem upset.

The Vulture

* Hell yeah, I'm upset.
* Your team disrupted a crime scene over which they have zero, zero jurisdiction.
* They were publicly drunk.
* Apparently one of them pressed all the buttons on the elevator.
* Oh, maybe he just bumped up against the panel with that big white ass of his.

Amy Santiago

* What now? Holt is gonna kill you.

Jake Peralta

* I don't think he will. Because... 

Charles Boyle

* Voila! 

Amy Santiago

* You actually found the corkscrew in the trash chute? 

Jake Peralta

* Stuck to the side, just like you said.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Boyle, we're pulling you out! 

Charles Boyle

* (slide down to the trash dump; got the corkscrew) This is the proudest moment of my career.
* Ah! (get hit by a bottle fallen down)  

(recall ends)  

Amy Santiago

* Oh, my God, you guys, we out-vultured the vulture! Ah-Ah- (mimicing the vulture)  

Jake Peralta

* What the hell was that? 

Amy Santiago

* What? It's a vulture.

Jake Peralta

* Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take this corkscrew over to the D.A.
* So we get the collar, not Major Crimes.

Terry Jeffords

* Peralta! Now.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.
* Before you get mad...

Terry Jeffords

* Shut it! Holt was right.
* I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids.

Jake Peralta

* That's insulting.

Terry Jeffords

* I should've been on you guys more.
* And starting now, I will be.
* But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand.

Jake Peralta

* You don't mean that.

Terry Jeffords

* Try me.

Jake Peralta

* Okay.
* Where you going? 

Terry Jeffords

* The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault.
* I can't let that happen.

Jake Peralta

* Wait.
* Damn it.
* Look, it's not your fault either.
* And it's not the vulture's fault.
* It's Amy's. (stared by Terry)  
* I know.
* I know.
* It's mine.
* It's mine, okay? God, I do not love how this worked out.

(into the office)  
Jake Peralta

* Detective Pembroke.

The Vulture

* Now what? 

Jake Peralta

* I'd like to cordially ['kɔːdiəl]['kɔːdʒəl] (sincerely) invite you to calm down, especially considering that this case has already been solved, by you! Looks like you found the murder weapon.
* It's a good thing you realized it was magnetically stuck to the inside of the trash chute.
* Congratulations.

Captain Ray Holt

* Cracked the case all by yourself.
* We done here? 

The Vulture

* Yeah.
* Yeah, we're done here.
* Hey, keep up the bad work, champ.

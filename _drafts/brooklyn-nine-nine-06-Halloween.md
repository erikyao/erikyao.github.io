(two perps still fighting even held by cops)  

Amy Santiago

* Whoa! Settle.
* (touched Sarge's files on desk) Sorry, sarge.
* Ugh, Halloween [ˌhæləʊ'iːn] is the worst.
* Everyone's drunk, wearing a mask, and carrying a fake gun.
* Plus all the girls think they have to dress sexy.

Jake Peralta

* I know, that is the worst.
* Please make them stop.

Amy Santiago

* I passed a slutty tree on the way here.
* Who wants to have sex with a tree? 

Scully 

* Was it a maple? 

Jake Peralta

* Was it a maple? (Amy just leaves)  

Charles Boyle

* Buon giorno, buon giorno. (是在模仿 Bonjour [bɔʒu:r]?)  
* Pretty cool 'stume, huh? 

Jake Peralta

* 'Stume? 

Charles Boyle

* Short for costume ['kɒstjuːm] (戏服, 服装) (cosplay == costume play?). 

Jake Peralta

* Ah.
* All right, let me guess.
* You are dumpy (short and fat) Chuck Norris.

Charles Boyle

* No, I'm... 

Rosa Diaz

* Dumpy Ron Weasley.

Charles Boyle

* No.

Terry Jeffords

* You guys, stop it.
* He put thought into his costume, and he is obviously Miranda from _Sex and the City_.

Charles Boyle

* Guys, I'm Mario Batali! "Molto Mario"? Celebrity chef? Ginger Prince of little Italy? 

Jake Peralta

* Is he also a homeless troll doll? 'Cause you look like a homeless troll doll.

A Perp Passing By

* Hey, sweet Batali costume, dude.

Charles Boyle

* Thank you! There's a man with impeccable [ɪm'pekəb(ə)l] taste.

Jake Peralta

* He bit a guy's butt off at a WNBA game.
* (you are) Eric Stoltz from _Mask_.

Charles Boyle

* I'll take it.

Terry Jeffords

* I hope you're all well rested.
* It's gonna be a busy night.

Jake Peralta

* The holding cell's completely full.
* I keep having to separate Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-Un.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Stop it! Stop making out! 
* Hey no! What would Bill say? 

(recall ends)  

Captain Ray Holt

* We need two undercovers at the Dekalb street warehouse party.
* Er...Boyle, you're already in costume as, uh, Joy Behar? 

Charles Boyle

* I'm Mario Batali.

Captain Ray Holt

* Okay.
* And, uh, Santiago, you go with him.

Amy Santiago

* Yes, sir.
* Damn it.

Charles Boyle

* Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.

Amy Santiago

* Can you magically make everyone kind, sober, and fully dressed? 

Jake Peralta

* "Kind, sober, and fully dressed." Good news, everyone, we found the name of Santiago's sex tape.

(sometime later)  
Jake Peralta

* Well, ring it up, nerds.
* I just arrested my first Halloween idiot of the season.
* He was trying to rob a bank but had a little trouble with the getaway (逃跑).

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Trying to "split" huh? Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get out on "a peel (剥皮)." (the robber is a man in banana costume; "a peel" is a pun to "appeal") 
* I'm so glad you're stuck.
* I've got a million of these.
* No, no, don't touch the money! Ugh! (触发了一个整人道具)  

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* I swear, these perps are so stupid.
* I'd make a better criminal than any of them.

Charles Boyle

* Yeah, you would.
* You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit [ˈbændɪt].

Jake Peralta

* Thank you, Charles.
* And the best part is, none of you could catch me.

Terry Jeffords

* Oh, come on, you... 

Captain Ray Holt

* I'm fairly certain you would be caught.
* No, scratch that.
* I'm 100% sure you'd be caught.

Jake Peralta

* Ho, ho, ho! All right, challenge accepted.

Captain Ray Holt

* I didn't issue a challenge.

Jake Peralta

* Fine.
* I'll issue it for you.
* What's the most valuable thing in your office? 

Captain Ray Holt

* My medal of valor ['vælə].

Jake Peralta

* God, you are such a hero.
* All right, how about this? I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office.

Captain Ray Holt

* Why would I possibly agree to that? 

Jake Peralta

* Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime (指不算到 overtime 里, 也就没有加班费).
* And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.
* But if I win...

Captain Ray Holt

* You won't.

Jake Peralta

* You have to do all of my paperwork tonight, the busiest and spookiest [spu:k] night of the year.
* And you have to publicly state that I'm an amazing Detective, slash genius. (指 Detective-genius)  

Captain Ray Holt

* And this won't interfere with you doing your job? 

Jake Peralta

* You mean my job as an amazing Detective-slash-genius? No, it will not.
* I'll do all of my work, guaranteed.

Captain Ray Holt

* I'm considering it.
* I'm interested.
* I agree to participate.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* There's the robot I fell in love with.

(sometime later)  
Rosa Diaz

* (to Terry) Hey.
* Sister Steve here got mugged.
* Some guy dressed as the Royal Baby punched him and took his wallet. (cannot help laughing)  

Sister Steve

* She keeps laughing at me.

Rosa Diaz

* Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school.
* Ten.

Terry Jeffords

* I didn't know you went to catholic school.

Rosa Diaz

* Good.
* You shouldn't know it.

Terry Jeffords

* I get it.
* You're so mysterious and tough.
* But you know what I think? You're actually a big softy.

Sister Steve

* No, I think she's really mean.

Terry Jeffords

* You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.

Rosa Diaz

* Didn't graduate.
* Had to leave.

Terry Jeffords

* Why? What'd you do? 

Rosa Diaz

* Here's a hint.
* I'm not gonna tell you.

Terry Jeffords

* Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.
* I'm a Detective.
* I will detect! 

Jake Peralta

* Hey.
* Got an arrest file here for the Captain.
* Drunk and disorderly.
* So, anyways Gina! We never talk anymore.
* How's the dance troupe [truːp]? Did you get a haircut? What's the Captain's schedule like today? 

Gina Linetti

* I'm not gonna help you rob him, Jake.
* I'm his assistant, and I take that job incredibly [ɪn'kredɪblɪ] seriously.
Jake Peralta

* You're literally making paper airplanes out of police reports right now.

Gina Linetti

* Well, how am I supposed to get it into that garbage can? 

Jake Peralta

* Come on. 

Gina Linetti

* Fine, Captain's got a meeting downstairs in ten minutes.

Jake Peralta

* You're the best.
* Mwah! 
* What does your skin taste like? 

Gina Linetti

* Dina Lohan. (Lindsay ['lɪndzi] Lohan 的妈妈)  
* I'm wearing her face lotion ['ləʊʃ(ə)n].

Jake Peralta

* That's it. (没错, 就是这个味)  

(on the steet)  

Charles Boyle

* Okay, party's around the corner.
* Tipster [ˈtɪpstə(r)] said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity.

Amy Santiago

* Why is this costume so stiff (inflexible)? And what is that smell? 

Charles Boyle

* The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit.
* Hey! I got you a chocolate.
* Yet another great thing about Halloween, chocolate! 

Amy Santiago

* Thanks.
* Oh, look.
* Raggedy (rag 破布; ragged 破烂的) Ann is drinking vodka right from the bottle. (纽约州禁止在公开场合携带已开瓶的酒)  
* People think if they put on a costume, they can just get away with anything they want.
* Halloween is Christmas for jerks.
* Come on, ma'am.
* No open containers (已开瓶的酒).

A Lady

* Oh, and why should I listen to you, bone person? 

Amy Santiago

* It's called skeleton. (Amy is in a skeleton costume)  
* It's a very common word.
* Just put the vodka ['vɒdkə] away.

The Lady

* You guys are cops? These guys are cops! (people around start yelling)  

(in the office)  
Captain Ray Holt 

* (noticed something wrong upward) Are you in my ceiling, Peralta? 

Jake Peralta

* (a voice from ceiling) No.

Captain Ray Holt

* So what's the plan? You wait for me to leave my office, lower yourself down, take my medal, and win the bet? 

Jake Peralta

* Who are you talking to? There's no one up here.

Captain Ray Holt

* Peralta, just so you know, right now, I am taking my medal off the wall, and placing it in a locked safe whose combination (指密码组合) is known only to me.
* The safe, in turn, is locked in the cabinet.
* The only key to that cabinet is on my person (在我身上).
* I'm off to my meeting.
* Good luck with your plan.

Jake Peralta

* You think that scares me? I laugh in the face of adversity! (Captain leaves)  
* Are you still there? Captain, are you still there? I can't hear...
* Agh! (fall down) Ow.

(sometime later)  
Jake Peralta

* Here you go. (hand a perp in costume to another cop)  
* Don't touch the butter.
* What happened? I thought you guys were supposed to be at the warehouse party.

Amy Santiago

* We got egged. (被扔了鸡蛋)  
* Some of the shell got in my contacts and my hair and my mouth and my bra.

Jake Peralta

* I can't tell if that's hot or not.

Amy Santiago

* Not hot.
* Eggshell in my bra is not hot.

Jake Peralta

* Well, it's kinda hot.
* Boobs go in a bra.
* Up top. (requests a high-five but Amy rejects)  

Charles Boyle

* (gets the high-five) Whoo! My man.

Jake Peralta

* Well, it sounds like costume duty is going great.

Charles Boyle

* So great.
* We're having the best time.
* Right, Amy? 

Amy Santiago

* I wish I was dead.

Jake Peralta

* Hmm.

Amy Santiago

* How's the unwinnable bet going? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, on the one hand, I fell through the ceiling and onto a pencil, but on the other hand, I also badly bruised my brain.

Rosa Diaz

* If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win.
* Like who wears more denim jackets.

Jake Peralta

* That was one time. (我就穿过一次)  
* You guys never forget anything.
* You know, frankly, I'm a little surprised you don't think I can win this thing.
* You're always telling me how I'm the best.

(recall starts)  
Charles Boyle

* You're the best, Jake. (handing over a coffee)  

Jake Peralta

* Paperwork delivery.

Charles Boyle

* You're the best, Jake.

Charles Boyle

* (in rest room) Jake, you're the best.

Jake Peralta

* Thank you, Charles.

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.

Terry Jeffords

* Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters.

Jake Peralta

* Really? 

Terry Jeffords

* But it's not about you or how smart you are.
* It's about Captain Holt.
* The man's a genius.
* He's had your number (知道你要做啥坏事) at every turn (everywhere or every time).

Jake Peralta

* Well, not this day, turn, time.
* Sorry, I'm pretty sure I had a concussion [kən'kʌʃ(ə)n] back there.
* Here I come. (fall on Terry)  

Terry Jeffords

* All right. (hold Jake up and put him on chair)  

Jake Peralta

* Ohh, strong.
* Ahh.

(Suspect Identification)  
Rosa Diaz

* Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up.
* Popular costume.
* Any of these guys look familiar? 

Sister Steve

* Maybe the third guy.
* The baby who mugged me was pretty short. (Rosa laughed)  
* You're not supposed to laugh at me.

Rosa Diaz

* Number three, step forward and say, "give me your money, you stupid bag of crap." 

Number Three

* Gimme your money, you stupid bag of crap.

Sister Steve

* No, wrong giant baby.

Terry Jeffords

* I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school.
* Were you doing drugs? 

Rosa Diaz

* Worse.

Terry Jeffords

* Selling drugs? 

Rosa Diaz

* Worse.

Terry Jeffords

* How bad could it have been? Did you burn down a church? 

Rosa Diaz

* Number three, step forward and say the word "worse." 

Number Three

* Worse.

Captain Ray Holt

* Excuse me, Gina.
* I can't find Peralta anywhere, and you're the only one who can decipher [dɪ'saɪfə] his handwriting.
* He arrested that bunny, but I don't know what for.
* He's either a crispy mother werewolf ['weəwʊlf] or cowboy mustard ['mʌstəd] (芥末), Oslo, Norway.

Gina Linetti

* Hmm.
* The bunny groped multiple women on the subway.
* Being able to read Jake's writing is a gift.
* A useless, useless gift.

Captain Ray Holt

* (saw a cleaner in the office) Excuse me one second.
* Nice costume, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* No Peralta here.
* Just a normal janitor ['dʒænɪtə] pushing trash around.

Captain Ray Holt

* Come out of there.

Jake Peralta

* (came out) Captain, hey.

Captain Ray Holt

* You really thought this was gonna work? 

Jake Peralta

* Uh, it did work.
* This whole janitor gambit ['ɡæmbɪt] was designed to fail.
* It's just like in chess.
* Sometimes in order to win, you have to sacrifice your king.

Captain Ray Holt

* That's exactly how you lose in chess.
* Have you ever played the game? 

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, I used to play with my uncle Bob all the time, and he said I was great.

(recall starts)  
Uncle Bob

* This is a game of concentration, Jake.
* So focus your mind, and start shooting.
* (Jake shot the chess pieces with an air gun)  
* Now you're a master of chess, huh? 

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* He taught me how to shoot backgammon (西洋双陆棋) too.

Captain Ray Holt

* I expected better of you.
* You could have at least created a diversion [daɪˈvɜ:ʃn] (divert [daɪ'vɜ:t]) to distract me from your terrible costume.

Jake Peralta

* Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.
* I had a diversion planned.
* There was just a slight timing issue. (a dust bin aside flares up)  
* Oh, my God! Get down, everyone! There's a big fire! 
* Captain, you better head over there for, like 15 minutes and see what's going on with that.
* Beware of the back draft.
* I'll be in your office.
* (Captain does not respond; a few seconds later) You have beautiful eyes.
* Have it your way.
* But you're gonna need this. (tear down his own false beards)  
* And that. (paste the false beards to Captain's mouth)  
* It's filthy ['fɪlθɪ] (dirty) in there.

(on the steet; in a disco club)  
Charles Boyle

* Come on, Amy! Loosen up (relax)! You look like such a cop! 
* Come on, have some fun, you know? It'll help you blend in! Whoo! 

Amy Santiago

* Stop trying to get me to love Halloween.
* It'll never work.

Charles Boyle

* I'm backing it up. (指背对着舞向 Amy)  

Amy Santiago

* Oh, God, please don't.
* Hey, heads up. (someone is selling drugs)  

Charles Boyle

* I'll cut 'em off at the exit.

Amy Santiago

* Okay.
* Move! Move, move! 
* He ditched the drugs. I'm on it.
* Ugh. (get down on the floor)  
* Oof, everything is sticking to me.
* Ooh.
* Ay, yes.

Someone Dancing

* Hey, watch out, man. (drinks dribbling down)  

Amy Santiago

* Ugh! What is that? How is it hot and cold? 

(back to PD)  
Captain Ray Holt

* (phoning) So the soonest you can fix the ceiling is Monday? 
* (some feathers come out from the air duct) I'm gonna have to call you back.

Jake Peralta

* (on the other side of the wall; holding several pigeons) Wait, stop scratching me.
* We're supposed to be a team.

Captain Ray Holt

* Keke Ahem.

Jake Peralta

* Captain, hi.
* I was just photocopying some stuff.

Captain Ray Holt

* Are you trying to jam pigeons into my air-conditioning vent to flush me out of my office? 

Jake Peralta

* Way to ruin the surprise.

Captain Ray Holt

* How did you get those birds? 

Jake Peralta

* By using my big, fat brain.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Get in the bag, you damn bird.
* Eat the bread.
* Eat the bread! 
* I gotcha! I gotcha! 

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* All part of my elaborate plan to defeat you.

Captain Ray Holt

* So far, you and your big, fat brain are losing badly.

Jake Peralta

* Maybe, if we're talking about who's winning our bet.
* But if we're talking about who's holding more birds, I'm winning, four-nothing.

Captain Ray Holt

* You're only holding two.

Jake Peralta

* Oh... Yeah.

Charles Boyle

* Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff.
* A guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five.

Hitchcock

* He high-fived me too.

Charles Boyle

* Wait. Hitchcock? (Hitchcock in Amy's skeleton costume)  

Hitchcock

* Darn it.
* I wasn't supposed to talk, but I got so excited about that astronaut.

Charles Boyle

* What is happening? 

Hitchcock

* Amy paid me 50 bucks to trade places with her for the rest of the night.

Charles Boyle

* Really? 

Hitchcock

* Yeah.
* I'm gonna use that money to buy two suits.

Jake Peralta

* Well, I was gonna ask you to tell the Captain that I brought in royal babies for Diaz, but I'm sure he already knows, since he's always one step ahead of me.

Gina Linetti

* Aww.
* Why so down, little clown? 

Jake Peralta

* I'm just sick of losing to Holt.
* I want that medal.

Gina Linetti

* It's not real gold.
* I tried selling it online.
* Zero bids.
* But here's some advice I gave to the girls in my dance troupe at the "dance till you drop" tournament.
* That advice was, dance. Dance! Dance.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, I'm not really sure that applies here, Gina.

Gina Linetti

* It does apply.
* It means don't give up.
* We would've won if Natasha's water (羊水) hadn't broken.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, Natasha had her baby? 

Gina Linetti

* You know Natasha? 

Jake Peralta

* Yeah.

Jake & Gina together

* Her dog has lupus ['lu:pəs] (狼疮).

Gina Linetti

* Yeah.
* That's a trip (an exciting or unusual experience).

Jake Peralta

* Small world.

Gina Linetti

* Yes.

Jake Peralta

* All right, I'm gonna go cry.

Gina Linetti

* I kind of feel bad for him. (to the phone speaker)  

Captain Ray Holt

* (on the phone) Don't.
* He brought this on himself.
* You can hang up now.

Charles Boyle

* You paid money to get out of working with me? 

Amy Santiago

* Charles, I had to.
* Tonight has been awful.
* Halloween is the worst, and I don't understand why you like it.

Charles Boyle

* No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great.
* The big kids egg you.
* Then you and your friends run away together.
* Friendships are forged in the crucible [ˈkru:sɪbl] (坩埚) of Halloween adversity.
* That's all I wanted for us.
* You can keep the wig.
* I don't need it anymore.

Amy Santiago

* I don't really need it either.

Jake Peralta

* Hey, Captain Holt, can you come out here for one sec? 

Captain Ray Holt

* (come out and lock the door) You need something, Peralta? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes, I do.
* Hit it, royal babies.
* (Royal Babies steal Captain's key)  
* (Captain gets back to his office and found Jake)  
* What! no! 

Captain Ray Holt

* Give me my keys.

Jake Peralta

* Will you stop catching me? Do you have any idea how much I spent on key chains? 

Captain Ray Holt

* $23.

Jake Peralta

* Wow, that is unbelievably close.
* 22.76

Captain Ray Holt

* Keys.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, look.
* Tonight has been a little humiliating.
* Things are not going well, so I'm gonna just throw this out there.
* What do you say we call off the bet and pretend this whole thing never happened? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Oh, I'm not letting you off the hook.

Jake Peralta

* What? No. Pfft.
* I meant to give you an out, so you could save face.

Captain Ray Holt

* This is getting sad.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, for you. (return the keys)  

Terry Jeffords

* So, I called your school.
* And I managed to get a hold of one sister Bernadette [ˌbɜːnəˈdɛt].

Rosa Diaz

* I remember that old bag.
* She was my favorite.

Terry Jeffords

* Well, guess what she said.
* Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition [vəˈlɪʃn].

Rosa Diaz

* Fine.
* The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the American Ballet Academy.
* I was a classical dancer.
* And I was good.

Terry Jeffords

* I knew it! I knew you were a big softy.

Rosa Diaz

* (if) You tell anyone, I (will) break your face.

Terry Jeffords

* No, you won't.
* You're too sensitive.

Amy Santiago

* Captain, sorry to interrupt.
* Some officers just arrested Peralta.

Captain Ray Holt

* What? 

Amy Santiago

* They caught him scaling the side of the building with a blowtorch (火焰喷灯).

(Interrogation Room)  
Jake Peralta

* Captain.
* Welcome to the endgame.
* Would you care to shake the hand of the man who defeated you? 
* Oh, forgot I was wearing handcuffs ['hændkʌf].
* Ohh, that hurt.
* Whoo! 

Captain Ray Holt

* Climbing the side of the building with a blowtorch.
* What were you thinking? 

Jake Peralta

* I was thinking I had better core strength (中枢肌肉力量).
* I got winded (wind the horse, 使马踹口气), like, ten feet up.

Captain Ray Holt

* I knew you wouldn't win the bet, but your performance tonight has made me question not only how good a Detective you are, but, quite frankly, how smart you are.

Jake Peralta

* Well, that's not surprising.
* You constantly underestimate me.

Captain Ray Holt

* No, you've been correctly estimated.
* You have five minutes until your deadline, and here you are, handcuffed to a table, in a locked room.

Jake Peralta

* Which is precisely where I planned on being.
* Captain, let me tell you a little story.
* You remember when I fell through your ceiling? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes, that was six hours ago.

Jake Peralta

* It was, I admit, a disastrous failure.
* But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met.
* With Herman, I commenced [kə'mens] (start, begin) the perfect crime.

Captain Ray Holt

* I caught you as Herman.

Jake Peralta

* But you didn't catch Rosa.

(recall starts)  
Captain

* Come out of there.

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* It turns out that Rosa is great at picking locks.

Captain Ray Holt

* Does not surprise me.

Jake Peralta

* No, me neither.
* Of course, I had to find a way to get her out of your office without you seeing her.
* So I created a diversion. (指废纸篓着火那个)  
* Not mistimed. Perfectly timed, so she could escape unseen.

Captain Ray Holt

* What about the pigeons? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, the gray pigeons? They were a red herring ['herɪŋ].
* Thank you.
* Their only purpose was to draw you into the copy room while two members of my team broke into your locked office (Amy and Terry).
* So now I had a way into your office and an open cabinet.
* All that was left was for the Royal Babies to steal your keys.

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes, but you didn't need the keys.
* The cabinet was already unlocked.
* You needed a way into the safe.

Jake Peralta

* And I got it.
* You were so concerned with getting your keys back, you didn't even notice the sergeant steal your phone.
* That's right, even the sergeant is on my side.
* I then had Charles dust your screen cover for prints.
* The greasiest smudges [smʌdʒ] revealed the four numbers you use the most, the four numbers in your passcode.
* Based on your advanced age, I assumed that you use the same passcode for everything, your phone, your email, and, of course, your safe.

Captain Ray Holt

* That would be a fair assumption.

Jake Peralta

* It was at that point that I bumped into a girl dressed as a sexy robot, and we got our flirt on, hard.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* 'Sup? 

Robot Girl

* 'Sup? 

Jake Peralta

* Jake Peralta.

(recall ends)  

Captain Ray Holt

* And how was flirting part of the plan? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, it wasn't.
* It just ruled.
* And that brings us to five minutes ago, when Amy came to your office and told you that I had been arrested.
* I knew she's the only one you would believe because, frankly, she's usually too lame to take part in these kinds of things.
* And as you walked over here, Charles awkwardly stuffed himself through your window and opened your safe.
* We had the four numbers of your code, which meant there were 24 possible combinations for Charles to try.
* That could take up to four minutes, which is why I really dragged out this explanation.
* I mean, really stretched it.
* I don't know if you noticed, but there were times where I was like, what am I even talking about? This isn't... 
* Oh.
* But now, four minutes is up.
* Which means Boyle is either on the other side of that door holding your medal, or I've lost.

Charles Boyle

* Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima... (Captain shut the door)  

Jake Peralta

* 20 seconds to spare. 
* Game over, Captain.
* Check me.

Captain Ray Holt

* I think you mean "checkmate". You really need to learn how to play chess.
* How did you get everyone to help you? 

Jake Peralta

* I appealed to their sense of teamwork and camaraderie [,kæmə'rɑːd(ə)rɪ] (comrade 的友爱, relationship) with a rousing ['raʊzɪŋ] speech that would put Shakespeare to shame.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* For too long, we've been put down, ridiculed ['rɪdɪkjuːl] (嘲笑; ridiculous [rɪ'dɪkjʊləs]), made to wear ties! But no more! For today, we defeat him! 

(recall ends)  

Captain Ray Holt

* And that worked? 

Jake Peralta

* No. No, no. Not at all.
* My speech did not inspire them.
* So I bribed them.
* I told them that if we pulled this off, I would do all of their paperwork.
* And since you're doing all my paperwork... 

Captain Ray Holt

* I'm impressed, Peralta.
* Well done.

Jake Peralta

* Thank you, sir.

Charles Boyle

* In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly... 

Jake Peralta

* Captain? 

Charles Boyle

* ...what provided our success.

Jake Peralta

* Sir? He's not coming back.

(sometime later)  
Terry Jeffords

* Boyle, I need you in the briefing room.

Charles Boyle

* (others all dressed in costumes) What is all this? 

Amy Santiago

* You know how I think Halloween is for jerks? Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk.
* I'm sorry about tonight.

Jake Peralta

* "I'm sorry about tonight". We found the title for Santiago's follow-up sex tape.

Charles Boyle

* I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.

Amy Santiago

* It's not your fault.
* I was terrible.

Jake Peralta

* "It's not your fault. I was terrible." is also one of your sex tapes.
* Ow. (hit by Amy)  

Amy Santiago

* Halloween is unbearable.
* But it was slightly less unbearable with you.
* Don't. (to Jake)  

Jake Peralta

* Okay.

Amy Santiago

* Anyway.
* We're all going to the bar, so get changed, 'cause you can't be the only one there not wearing a 'stume.

Charles Boyle

* 'Stume! Oh, my God.
* It caught on.

Jake Peralta

* No.

(out of the briefing room)  
Jake Peralta

* Ah, Captain Holt.
* It is so nice to see you.
* Never thought I'd say that.

Captain Ray Holt

* Hmm.
* A poor winner.
* I never would've guessed.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, you would've.
* Way to go all out on your costume, by the way.
* I believe you have an announcement to make, so the floor is yours.

Captain Ray Holt

* Attention, everyone.
* Jake Peralta is an amazing Detective-slash-genius.
* Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some paperwork to do.

Jake Peralta

* All right.

Rosa Diaz

* Officer in the 92nd got the Royal Baby mugger.
* He had 19 wallets in his diaper ['daɪəpə(r)] (尿布).

An Officer

* We got a runner! 

The Runner

* (knock down by Rosa) Waahhh! 

Terry Jeffords

* Damn! 

Rosa Diaz

* Oh, I didn't tell you.
* I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas [bælə'riːnə].

Hitchcock

* It's a good thing we gave'em heads up.

Scully

* Team effort. Go nine-nine.

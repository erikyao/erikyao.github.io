Jake Peralta

* Hey, cap'n, got a second? 

Captain Ray Holt

* It's "Captain". 

Jake Peralta

* What did I say? 

Captain Ray Holt

* "Cap'n", like Cap'n Crunch (to crush something, especially food, with a noisy crackling sound) (a product line of sweetened corn and oat breakfast cereals).

Jake Peralta

* All right, but to be fair, Cap'n Crunch was a war hero and the primary male role model in my house, growing up, so... 
* (stared by Captain) Anyways, cap-tain, you know that jewelry store robbery down by Grand Army Plaza? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Mm-hmm.

Jake Peralta

* I know who did it. Dustin Whitman. I put him in Rikers two years ago.
* He just got out, and the crime scene matches his M.O. perfectly.

(recall starts)  
Jake Peralta

* Okay, what do we got? 

A Cop

* Well, security cam shows a male suspect, 5'9"... 

Jake Peralta

* Wearing a black ski mask.
* He bypassed the McConnell alarm by using the magnetic kill switch.
* And he only stole diamonds, nothing over two carats.

The Cop

* Yeah, exactly.
* How'd you know? 

Jake Peralta

* I'm a Detective.
* It's what I do.
* I'm just kidding.
* I need a lot more information.
* But that would've been a great exit line (A line spoken by an actor immediately before leaving the stage.), right? 

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* The crime techs aren't done yet, but I'm 100% sure it's Whitman.

Captain Ray Holt

* Well, let's see what kind of physical evidence they turn up, and then we can talk arrest.

Jake Peralta

* Actually, hilarious [hɪˈleəriəs] story.
* So that is Dustin Whitman. (across the window)  

Captain Ray Holt

* You already arrested him? With insufficient evidence? 
* By law, we have 48 hours to find that evidence, or we have to let him go.
* You just started the clock.

Rosa Diaz

* What's up with this emergency meeting? 

Terry Jeffords

* (Amy came in in a pink dress) Whoa, Detective Santiago.

Amy Santiago

* Big date tonight.
* How do I look? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, I think you look... (sound from cellphone)  
* Sorry, that was supposed to be a catcall (表不满的嘘声).
* I don't know how this works.

Rosa Diaz

* Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell? 

Amy Santiago

* I just wanted to know how she got such smoky eyes.
* Turns out it was an STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) rash (皮疹).

Captain Ray Holt

* Detective Peralta has made a collar in the jewelry store heist [haɪst].

Charles Boyle

* Way to go, Jakey.

Jake Peralta

* Ah, that's okay.

Captain Ray Holt

* No! He didn't get sufficient evidence to make it stick, so we have the next 48 hours to fix his mistake.

Other Guys

* Damn it, Jake.

Amy Santiago

* What evidence did you have when you arrested this guy?

Jake Peralta

* Some pretty ironclad stuff.

(recall starts; on the street)  
Jake Peralta

* Dustin, it's been a while. Mind if I ask you a few questions? 

Dustin

* Well, well, well, if it isn't Joke Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* That's it, you're under arrest.

(recall ends)  

Jake Peralta

* Case closed? (Amy shakes her head)  

Captain Ray Holt

* If we don't find something conclusive, it jeopardizes ['dʒepədaɪz] (endanger) the case and opens the department up to a lawsuit.
* So cancel your plans.
* We're here until this is over.

Amy Santiago

* Damn it, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Ow! 

Captain Ray Holt

* I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.

Jake Peralta

* But? 

Captain Ray Holt

* That was it.
* I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.

(after the meeting; in the pantry (茶水间))  
Captain Ray Holt

* Terry, you just pulled two doubles (double 指加两份浓缩咖啡的咖啡).
* You must be tired.
* I'll stay for this Whitman debacle [dɪˈbɑkəl].
* You go home.

Terry Jeffords

* I'm not tired.
* Why would you think I was tired? I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups (chin 是下巴, chin-up 是引体向上) on muscle memory alone.
* Tired Terry still gets after it (to move into action), that's all I'm saying.

Rosa Diaz

* Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner? They make the best pies in New York City.

Gina Linetti

* Oopsie, you said something super dumb.
* The best pie in the city's at Crust.

Rosa Diaz

* Wrong.
* Ignorant and wrong.

Gina Linetti

* Uh, you think you can just bully people, but you can't.
* It's not okay.
* I'm the bully around here, ask anyone.

Rosa Diaz

* Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website.
* Which pie's better? 

Gina Linetti

* Yeah, whose do you like better, mine or Rosa's? 

Charles Boyle

* Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet.

Gina Linetti

* Why is your eye twitching? 

Charles Boyle

* Wouldn't you like to know? 

Gina Linetti

* Could I see you for a second in the evidence lockup? 

(in the evidence lockup)  
Gina Linetti

* Charles, I know what's going on.
* You've tried both pies.
* You know mine is better.
* But you're scared to tell Rosa, 'cause you're into her.

Charles Boyle

* What? That is not true, okay? I-I-I don't even like food.

Gina Linetti

* What? 

Charles Boyle

* Who's Rosa? Y-you're the scared one.

(outside the interrogation room)  
Captain Ray Holt

* Planning your strategy? 

Jake Peralta

* No, I'm just making funny faces at him.
* This mirrored glass is awesome.
* It straight-up works.

Captain Ray Holt

* An effective use of your limited time.

Jake Peralta

* It is, actually.
* That's how I got him last time.
* Let him stew for a little bit, got in his head, and he confessed.

Captain Ray Holt

* You better be right.

Jake Peralta

* I am.
* Hey, make some funny faces while I'm in there.
* I wanna see if I can tell.

Dustin

* I didn't do anything, Joke.

Jake Peralta

* That's funny.
* You said the exact same thing last time.
* And how'd that work out for you? Let's take a look. (some pictures)  
* Okay. Here's you at your trial.
* You in prison.
* Me meeting Regis Philbin (脱口秀主持人).
* That was fun.
* You still in prison.
* Me at Splash Mountain (Disney 的滑水娱乐项目), just pepper (to add pepper to) these in here.
* You in prison, you in prison, you in prison, you get it.

Dustin

* You got the wrong guy.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* Not ready to confess? Fine by me.
* I got all the time in the world.

Dustin

* No, you actually have 48 hours.
* I know the law.

Jake Peralta

* Nuh-uh.

(outside the interrogation room)  
Jake Peralta

* So looks like we're gonna be here for a while.
* Should someone do a coffee run? You know what? Coffee's on me.
* Oh, but no froofy Frappuccinos [,frɑpə'tʃino] or anything, I've only got, like, 10 bucks. (grasped by Amy)  
* Okay.

(the next morning; all stayed up in PD)  
Captain Ray Holt

* Rise and shine, detectives, rise and shine.
* Peralta, I want you to bring everyone up to speed.

Jake Peralta

* You slept in your office, and you look exactly the same.
* How (did you make it)? 

Captain Ray Holt

* What are you talking about? My hair is a mess.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, yeah.

Captain Ray Holt

* Briefing room, five minutes.

Charles Boyle

* How long were we asleep? 

Terry Jeffords

* Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout.
* So, like, three hours.

Rosa Diaz

* Morning. (came in vigorously)  

Jake Peralta

* Ugh.
* I can't believe you live nearby and you won't let anyone crash (to experience informal temporary living arrangements) at your place.

Rosa Diaz

* You people already know too much about me.

Jake Peralta

* I know exactly three facts about you, and one of them is that you won't let any of us crash at your place.

Rosa Diaz

* Is that a nightgown? (to Amy)  

Terry Jeffords

* That's mine.
* It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.

Jake Peralta

* (reading words on the t-shirt's back) "If at first you don't secede [sɪ'si:d], try try again." (南方种族主义言论, secede 指脱离合众国)  

Terry Jeffords

* When you're that big, you buy anything that fits.
* A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, a couple of quick announcements.
* First, I met our night janitor Ronald.
* If any of you are missing hand sanitizer ['sænɪtaɪz] (洗手液), he drank it. (Amy stopped drinking her coffee)  
* Second, our warrants finally went through.
* We gotta place Whitman at the scene and prove that he either possessed or sold those diamonds.

Captain Ray Holt

* I know you're all tired, but don't forget why we're here.

Jake Peralta

* Because we're dedicated detectives.

Captain Ray Holt

* Because Peralta jumped the gun (begin a race before the starting gun goes off).

Jake Peralta

* Yep.

Captain Ray Holt

* Get to work.

Jake Peralta

* So we both had good answers.

Amy Santiago

* This isn't a joke.
* You're ruining our weekend.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, I'm sorry you had to cancel dinner with your dad.

Amy Santiago

* Date.
* I had a date.

Rosa Diaz

* Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it.

Jake Peralta

* Thank you.
* Everyone listen to Rosa.

Rosa Diaz

* No, I'm still furious [ˈfjʊəriəs] at you.

Jake Peralta

* Okay, no one listen to Rosa.
* She's clearly an accomplice [əˈkʌmplɪs](共犯) to this crime.
* I'm gonna go take another crack at Whitman.

Amy Santiago

* You've been in there, like, five times.
* What are you gonna do? Annoy him into talking? 

Jake Peralta

* Ha, ha.

(in Interrogation Room; Jake playing guitar)  
Jake Peralta

* (singing) Two, three, four.
* Aah~~~~~! 

(came out)  
Jake Peralta

* Didn't work.
* Thank you. (pass the guitar to Terry)  
* Did not work.

(several hours later)  
Jake Peralta

* Hey, Captain.
* Will you please let everyone else go? I feel bad that I ruined their weekend, and I can tell they're pissed at me.
* I mean, Charles hasn't tried to high-five me all morning.

Captain Ray Holt

* Yes, I've taken the brunt [brʌnt] of that.

(recall starts)  
Charles Boyle

* Kitchen buds. (an up top)  

(recall ends)  

Captain Ray Holt

* Are you sure Whitman did it? 

Jake Peralta

* Yes, I'm positive.

Captain Ray Holt

* Then the whole team stays.
* We have a better shot with everyone on it.

Jake Peralta

* Fine, will you at least tell Hitchcock to go home? His mouth smells like rotten trout [traʊt] (鳟鱼) milk.

Captain Ray Holt

* Is there such a thing? 

Jake Peralta

* I'm just telling you what it smells like.

Captain Ray Holt

* Get out.

Jake Peralta

* Do you have the bank records? 

Amy Santiago

* Mm-hmm.
* Good thing I didn't reschedule my date for tonight.
* We're never leaving here.

Jake Peralta

* Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know? Saved you from another lame Internet date with some lame guy named Dirk or Mar... garine.

Amy Santiago

* He's not lame, okay? He works with a friend of mine.
* He has a human name.
* And I'm not telling you what it is, because you'll look him up and make fun of him.

Jake Peralta

* I can't believe you think so little of me, that you would just automatically assume... 
* (searching on the internet) Is it Luke Mueller? 

Amy Santiago

* How did you do that? 

Jake Peralta

* Well, you only have one friend, Kylie.
* And she has seven male coworkers.
* Goatee (山羊胡), goatee, jaunty ['dʒɔ:ntɪ] fedora [fɪ'dɔ:rə], profile pic is a sunset, Tasmanian [tæz'meiniən] devil tattoo, goatee.
* Leaving Luke as the only viable [ˈvaɪəbl] option.

Amy Santiago

* Well, he's nice, and he uses proper punctuation in texts.

Jake Peralta

* Dreamboat.

Amy Santiago

* And I wanted to go out with him.

Jake Peralta

* All right.
* You know what? Reschedule for tonight.
* I promise I will get us out of here in time.

Amy Santiago

* Fine.
* I'm holding you to that.

Rosa Diaz

* Where's he taking you (指约会对象)? 

Amy Santiago

* Terrific, let's get everyone involved.
* Dinner and a movie. (Rosa makes a face to Amy)  
* Dinner and a movie is the perfect first date.

Charles Boyle

* I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together. (looking to Rosa)  
* And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo! Kissing.

Rosa Diaz

* For me, cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down.

Charles Boyle

* So pretty much the same as what I said.

(at night)  
Rosa Diaz

* None of the partials (指 fingerprint) match Whitman.
* If he did it, he didn't leave any prints.

Charles Boyle

* Maybe he doesn't have any.
* Interesting fact about me, I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok (锅).

Gina Linetti

* Hi, hello.

Charles Boyle

* What are you doing? 
* Holt said you didn't have to come in here.
* You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.

Gina Linetti

* Because I'm so nice, I brought two pies.
* One is from Crust.
* And one's also from Flatbush Diner.
* Hey, you know what might be fun? Charles could try them and tell us which one is better.
* How fun is that? 

Charles Boyle

* So fun.

Gina Linetti

* Yay! Yum, yum, yum.
* Yummy.

Terry Jeffords

* You got a second, Captain? I've got these overtime forms for you to s...

Captain Ray Holt

* Are you stifling ['staɪfl] (hold back) a yawn [jɔ:n] (哈欠)? 

Terry Jeffords

* No, sir.

Captain Ray Holt

* Go home, sergeant.

Terry Jeffords

* I'm fine.
* And I filled this out.
* I just need you to... 
* Permission to yawn, sir.

Captain Ray Holt

* Go home.

Amy Santiago

* Please, I'm begging you. (deodorant [dɪ'əʊdərənt] 止汗剂)  

Jake Peralta

* Oh, fair enough.

Amy Santiago

* Yeah.

Jake Peralta

* That's for women.
* These your glasses? 

Amy Santiago

* Mm-hmm.

Jake Peralta

* They're gigantic.

Amy Santiago

* My contacts dried out, thanks to you.
* And they're cool.

Jake Peralta

* No, they're not. (put on Amy's glasses)  
* Wow, you are blind blind.

Amy Santiago

* Yeah.

Jake Peralta

* You're a blind cop.
* How has there not been a made-for-TV movie about your struggles? 

Amy Santiago

* Give those back.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, okay.
* Wait a minute.
* I did it.
* I got Whitman, dead to rights.

Amy Santiago

* I can still make my date? 

Jake Peralta

* As I promised.
* Go get changed.
* And by that, of course I mean throw your glasses in the garbage, then get laser surgery (激光矫正), then recuperate [rɪ'ku:pəreɪt] (recover, especially from an illness)... (Amy has already gone)  
* And she left the room.

Charles Boyle

* It's all right. (tasting a pie)  
* 6 out of 12? 

Gina Linetti

* Out of 12? Why? 

Charles Boyle

* For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami [u'mɑmi], odor, sound... 

Gina Linetti

* Sound? Come on, Charles.
* Try her nasty pie.

Charles Boyle

* Oh, wow. (frown)  
* That's the best pie I ever had.

Gina Linetti

* No, no.
* (Rosa laughing) No, no, no.

Terry Jeffords

* What's this? 

Charles Boyle

* We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.

Terry Jeffords

* I didn't ask what you were doing.
* I asked what you are doing.

Rosa Diaz

* Pie taste test, it's over.
* I won.

Terry Jeffords

* That's unacceptable.
* If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place.
* Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places.
* We gonna be here awhile.

Jake Peralta 

* Debit card statement.
* You were at a parking meter two blocks from the jewelry store an hour before the robbery.

Dustin

* Oh, no, you found out... about my wife.
* We both have cards, because we share a joint account, because we love each other.

Jake Peralta

* You're incapable of love, and I'll prove it! 
* Oh, I'm very tired.

Dustin

* I want my lawyer, now.

Jake Peralta

* Ugh! You have changed.
* You used to go straight to prison! 

Amy Santiago

* (in pink dress again) Did Whitman talk? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, he talked all right.

Captain Ray Holt

* He asked for his lawyer.

Jake Peralta

* By using words, which is technically talking.
* We can't ask him any more questions till we find his lawyer, and we can't find his lawyer anywhere.
* I'm sorry.

Amy Santiago

* (sit down unhappily) Aah, come on.
* Why is there pie here? 

Jake Peralta

* That's not good.
* I think the world of you, as a colleague and friend.

Amy Santiago

* Shut up, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Yep.

Gina Linetti

* Yes! 

Terry Jeffords

* Another one for Crust.
* It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.

Rosa Diaz

* Ah, come on! 

Jake Peralta

* You went home and showered? That's so unfair.

Charles Boyle

* I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.

Jake Peralta

* Oh, cool.
* Hey, can I borrow it? 

Charles Boyle

* Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush? 

Amy Santiago

* What possible answer could he give that would make you say yes? 

Jake Peralta

* I wanna brush my teeth.

Charles Boyle

* Jake, it's been in my mouth.

Amy Santiago

* That's the grossest thing I've ever heard.

Jake Peralta

* That's the grossest thing you've ever heard? You caught a guy on the subway with a bag of human ears.

Amy Santiago

* Your thing's grosser.

Terry Jeffords

* Bring out the meringues [məˈræŋ].

Gina Linetti

* I brought a few more.

Jake Peralta

* That's so many.

(in evidence lockup)  
Terry Jeffords

* You wanted something, sir? 

Captain Ray Holt

* Look, it's impossible to make you leave.
* But you do have to sleep, and that's an order.

Terry Jeffords

* Sir, this is not necessary.
* Also, can't sleep without my whale songs.

Captain Ray Holt

* Terry, I've seen this before.
* Problems at home, so you stay late at the job, but that only makes it worse.

Terry Jeffords

* Everything's great with my wife.
* It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along.
* He thinks I'm a weakling [ˈwi:klɪŋ] (a weak person).

Captain Ray Holt

* You? 

(recall starts)  
brother-in-law (a even taller and stronger person than Terry)  

* Let me get that for you.

Terry Jeffords

* I can do it.

brother-in-law

* Tiny Terry loves his pickles (腌菜).

(recall ends)  

Terry Jeffords

* He makes me feel so small.

Captain Ray Holt

* Who cares what he thinks? You're a police sergeant.
* You're a grown man.
* Now take your nap.
* And if I see the lights on in here, I'm gonna be very disappointed in you.

Lawyer

* Are you the idiot that made a Friday night arrest? I was in the Poconos (northeastern Pennsylvania 度假胜地) with my wife.
* You ruined my entire weekend.

Jake Peralta

* Get in line, because that's their attitude.
* Get your own attitude.

Lawyer

* He has an alibi, geniuses (genius ['dʒi:nɪəs]).
* He was at Torque. It's a nightclub in Cape May, New Jersey, all night.

Jake Peralta

* Nice try.
* You think I'm gonna waste six hours driving to the Jersey Shore and back on some fake alibi? 

Lawyer

* It's up to you.
* But in ten hours, he walks.

Jake Peralta

* More like in ten hours, he walks into prison, when we bust him.

Captain Ray Holt

* Let's follow up on his alibi.

Jake Peralta

* Yep, you heard him. Scully, hit the road.

Captain Ray Holt

* No. You should've looked into this before you made the arrest.
* You go.

Scully

* Oh, Captain, I'm happy to go.
* I love the saltwater taffy ([ˈtæfi] 太妃糖) down there.

Jake Peralta

* Scully loves the saltwater taffy down there.

Captain Ray Holt

* No, Peralta's going.
* Go, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* Look, I know I caused this problem, but I can fix it.
* We just got some new security footage in.
* Let me stay here and go through it.
* I'm gonna prove that Whitman was at the scene of the crime, even if it kills me.

(7 hours later)  
Jake Peralta

* This is killing me.

Amy Santiago

* Good.
* Die.

Jake Peralta

* You know, if it does come to that, I have but one wish before I go.
* Can I please put your glasses on my penis? I just think that would be really funny.

Charles Boyle

* Hey, can you make copies of these warrant requests for me? 

Gina Linetti

* I'm not your secretary.

Charles Boyle

* You're everyone's secretary.
* That's literally your job.

Gina Linetti

* And your job is lying about your taste buds? 

Charles Boyle

* I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing.
* You're right.
* The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.

Gina Linetti

* Thank you.

Charles Boyle

* It's just... I want Rosa to like me.

Gina Linetti

* All right, do whatever you want, but most women don't really like it when dudes lie to them.
* Except for me, but I'm wired (slang, excited) to thrive [θraɪv] on dysfunction (disfunction).

Amy Santiago

* (watching the footage) Nothing.
* Wait, wait, wait.
* This guy, 5'9'' (直接读 five nine) or 5'10'', black knit cap.

Jake Peralta

* Come on, come on, come on.
* Gotcha! 

Amy Santiago

* Ugh, it's not him.
* Let's just arrest this guy.
* Who even cares anymore? 

Jake Peralta

* So how'd my new best friend Luke take it when you cancelled on him again? 

Amy Santiago

* Don't know, hasn't called me back.
* Which is what always happens, because it's impossible to be a cop and date.

Jake Peralta

* Amy, look.
* There is a guy out there, with incredibly low standards and a super weird soul patch, and he is waiting for you. (printed out the suspect's piecture)  
* Amy, my patch tingles (slang, become excited) for you.
* We will wed (have a wedding) on the isle of New Jersey (指 New Jersey 的 Sea Isle City).
* Our first dance will be to _Jessie's Girl_, because my name is definitely Jessie.

Amy Santiago

* It's so romantic.

Scully

* Hey, guys.

Jake Peralta

* Hey.

Scully

* Yeah, there's good news, and there's bad news.
* The bad news is my saltwater taffy place was closed.

Captain Ray Holt

* And the good news? 

Scully

* Whitman's alibi checked out (to prove to be the case after an investigation, 证实, 成立).
* Security footage from Torque shows he was there.

Jake Peralta

* That's not good news.
* That's bad news.

Scully

* Right.
* That is bad news.
* Sorry, it's on me.

Captain Ray Holt

* No, Detective Scully. It's on Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* No, Captain. That's on Santiago. (hit by Amy)  
* It's on me.
* It's still on me.

Terry Jeffords

* This is such a disaster.

Captain Ray Holt

* It's not good.
* D.A.'s furious.
* Whitman and his lawyer are in my office right now, gunning for (aim at) a lawsuit.

Terry Jeffords

* No, not that.
* My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK.
* (stared by Captain) But also the botched [bɒtʃ] (messed) investigation, that's bad too.

Amy Santiago

* Okay, what can I do? 

Jake Peralta

* Oh, your services will not be necessary, because you need to go home and change for your date.

Amy Santiago

* What? 

Jake Peralta

* I called handsome Luke.
* I explained the weekend was entirely my fault, partially.
* And he wants to go out with you tonight.

Amy Santiago

* Thanks, Peralta.

Jake Peralta

* You're welcome.
* Just promise me you won't use the condoms in the secret pocket of your purse, okay? They're expired.

Amy Santiago

* How do you know what's in my purse? 

Jake Peralta

* I needed concealer [kən'silɚ] for a zit (痘痘).
* Plus, you know, we spend so much time together here, I know everything about everyone.
* I know Hitchcock went bald at 15.
* Scully used to date Hitchcock's wife.
* Charles has a bike with a little basket on the front.

Charles Boyle 

* How else would you carry baguettes [bæˈget](法式长棍)? 

Jake Peralta

* And Rosa has a shower in her apartment, I think.
* I got nothing on her.

Rosa Diaz

* Good.

Amy Santiago

* Well, I guess we did just spend 48 hours locked in here together.

Jake Peralta

* Holy crap.

Amy Santiago

* What? 

Jake Peralta

* Locked in here together.

(in the office)  
Lawyer

* So we will be filing a wrongful arrest suit against the NYPD.

Dustin

* And when I win, I'm gonna buy club Torque, put a statue of Jake Peralta right in the middle of the dance floor.

Jake Peralta

* First off, that's a terrible threat.
* I would love to have a statue of myself in the middle of a dance club.
* Second, do me a favor, take a look at this picture, and tell me what you see.

Dustin

* You and Regis Philbin.

Jake Peralta

* Awesome, right? Surprisingly down-to-earth guy and definitely not the picture I meant to show you.
* But take a look at this.
* That's right, it's you and your old cell mate Marcus Cole.
* And here he is again outside the jewelry store.
* The two of you planned this together in prison.
* You taught him your M.O., he pulled off the robbery, you got yourself an alibi, and you split the loot [lu:t] (分赃).
* (mimic Marcus Cole) Oh, man, I can't believe he caught us.
* (mimic Regis Philbin) Of course he did, Peralta is the best! 
* Aw, thanks, reg.

Captain Ray Holt

* That's enough.

Jake Peralta

* Yeah, I gotta work on my Regis (意思是我学得还不像).
* Anyway, see ya in jail, Whitman.

Captain Ray Holt

* (to Dustin and the lawyer) You got anything else to say? 

Charles Boyle

* Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible.
* It's inedible [ɪnˈedəbl] (not suitable to eat).
* Food is supposed to be edible.

Rosa Diaz

Jake Peralta

Captain Ray Holt

* Everyone's tired, Peralta.
* They just wanna go home.

Jake Peralta

Terry Jeffords

* Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.

# Overview

Copy the original `_layouts/xxx.html` to this folder for modification/customization.

See [Overriding Theme Defaults](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/overriding-theme-defaults/).

# "single" layout

"single" layout is my default one for "pages" and "posts", as configured in my `_config.yml`.

`_layouts/single.html` is from minimal-mistakes' commit [ef464c8](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/ef464c868ea950e54d228564246e54a2720d1bec/_layouts/single.html). May need manual updates in the future.

Note that "single" layout is inherited from ["default"](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_layouts/default.html). The rendering process is like:

1. copy all the tags from `_layouts/single.html`
2. paste to the `{{ content }}` line of `_layout/default.html`
3. render the altered `_layout/default.html`

so your modification to "single" layout should only happens in `_layouts/single.html`.

## Modification 1: Turned off `sanntize`

In my commit [2e219f3](https://github.com/erikyao/erikyao.github.io/commit/2e219f35cf9907fb9b9258368c299f80a3180d3f), the `sanitize` option is set to `false` when including the `toc.html`. This change can preseve the "code block" style in headings, when rendering the ToC.

More ToC rendering options can be found in minimal-mistakes' [`_include/toc.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/85e1ba131e93a1eedaa92ed20abf4bec3ef0847b/_includes/toc.html#L26):

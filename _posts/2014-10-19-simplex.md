概念挺简单，主要是生单词太多了，mark 一下。

| face                         | 面，不过在 Simplex 这里与我们常用的面的概念有点不同  |
| edge                         | 边     |

In geometry, a **simplex** (plural _simplexes_ or _simplices_) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, a _**k**_-simplex is a _**k**_-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its _**k+1**_ vertices. 

Specially, 

* a single point may be considered a 0-simplex
* a line segment may be considered a 1-simplex
* a triangle may be considered a 2-simplex
* a tetrahedron may be considered a 3-simplex

The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the _**n+1**_ points that define an _**n**_-simplex is called a **face** of the simplex. If the size of this subset is _**m+1**_, we call this face an _**m**_-face.

Specially, 

* 0-faces are called the vertices
* 1-faces are called the edges
* _**(n−1)**_-faces are called the **facets**
* the sole _**n**_-face is the whole _**n**_-simplex itself

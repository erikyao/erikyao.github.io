## 1. Introduction

Some are _**date-only**_ classes, some are _**datetime**_ classes. All classes can handle calendar dates (e.g., March 15, 2010), but not all can represent a datetime (e.g., 11:45 AM on March 1, 2010).

The following classes are included in the base distribution of R:

* `Date`: _**date-only**_. 
	* General-purpose class for working with dates
* `POSIXct`: _**datetime**_. 
	* Internally, the datetime is stored as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and so is a very compact representation. 
	* This class is recommended for storing datetime information (e.g., in data frames).
	* "ct" stands for "calender time"
	* 我觉得 stands for "compact time" 也说得通
* `POSIXlt`: _**datetime**_. 
	* Stored in a 9-element list. 
	* Easy to extract date parts, such as the month or hour. 
	* Obviously, this representation is much less compact than the `POSIXct` class; hence it is normally used for intermediate processing and not for storing data.
	* "lt" stands for "local time"
	* "lt" also helps one remember that `POXIXlt` objects are _lists_
	
`POSIXlt` 举例：
	
```r
> tm1.lt <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())
> tm1.lt
[1] "2015-02-07 23:19:29 CST"
> unlist(tm1.lt) ## unlist: simplifies a list structure to produce a vector which contains all the atomic components
               sec                min               hour               mday 
"29.5144650936127"               "19"               "23"                "7" 
               mon               year               wday               yday 
               "1"              "115"                "6"               "37" 
             isdst               zone             gmtoff 
               "0"              "CST"            "28800" 

> unclass(tm1.lt) ## 效果类似 unlist。这里我们是把 POSIXlt 看做一个 object，然后 unclass 的作用是 returns (a copy of) its fields with its class attribute removed
> ... ## 输出省略
```

`POSIXlt` 实际是一个 11-element list，只是前 9 个相对常用一点：

* sec: 0–61; seconds.
* min: 0–59; minutes.
* hour: 0–23; hours.
* mday: 1–31; day of the month
* mon: 0–11; months after the first of the year.
* year: years since 1900.
* wday: 0–6; day of the week, starting on Sunday.
* yday: 0–365; day of the year.
* isdst: Daylight Saving Time flag. Positive if in force, zero if not, negative if unknown.
* zone: (Optional) The abbreviation for the time zone in force at that time; "" if unknown (but "" might also be used for UTC).
	* UTC: Coordinated Universal Time
	* CST: China Standard Time, i.e. UTC+08:00
* gmtoff: (Optional) The offset in minutes from GMT; positive values are East of the meridian. Usually NA if unknown, but 0 could mean unknown.

The base distribution also provides functions for easily converting between representations: `as.Date`, `as.POSIXct`, and `as.POSIXlt`.

The following packages are available for downloading from CRAN:

* `chron`: 
	* No time zones and daylight savings time. 
	* It’s therefore easier to use than `Date` but less powerful than `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt`. 
	* It would be useful for work in econometrics or time series analysis.
* `lubridate`:
	* a wrapper for `POSIXct` with more intuitive syntax
* `mondate`:
	* This is a specialized package for handling dates in units of months in addition to days and years. 
	* Such needs arise in accounting and actuarial work, for example, where month-by-month calculations are needed.
* `timeDate`: 
	* This is a high-powered package with well-thought-out facilities for handling dates and times, including date arithmetic, business days, holidays, conversions, and generalized handling of time zones. 
	* It was originally part of the Rmetrics software for financial modeling, where precision in dates and times is critical.
	
Which class should you select? The article [Date and Time Classes in R](http://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2004-1.pdf) by Grothendieck and Petzoldt offers this general advice:

> When considering which class to use, always choose the least complex class that will support the application. That is, use `Date` if possible, otherwise use `chron` and otherwise use the POSIX classes. Such a strategy will greatly reduce the potential for error and increase the reliability of your application.

## 2. Basic Date Operation

### 2.1 Getting the Current Date

```r
> Sys.Date()
[1] "2015-02-08"
> class(Sys.Date()) ## Sys.Date() returns a Date object
[1] "Date"
```

Similarly `Sys.time()` returns the current date-time:

```r
> Sys.time() ## 注意 Date() 是大写，time() 是小写
[1] "2015-02-08 11:28:02 CST"
> class(Sys.time())
[1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 
> unclass(Sys.time()) 
[1] 1423366132 ## 可见本身是个 POSIXct
```

这里 `class(Sys.time())` 返回了两个值要特别说明一下：`class(object)` returns a character vector giving the names of the classes from which the object **inherits**.

### 2.2 Converting a String into a Date

The default format assumed by `as.Date` is the ISO 8601 standard format of _yyyy-mm-dd_:

```r
> as.Date("1985-11-30")
[1] "1985-11-30"
```

Use `format="%m/%d/%Y"` if the date string is in American style _mm/dd/yyyy_:

```r
> as.Date("11/30/1985")
Error in charToDate(x) : 
  character string is not in a standard unambiguous format
> as.Date("11/30/1985", format="%m/%d/%Y")
[1] "1985-11-30"
```
	
`?strftime` or `?strptime` for details about allowed formats.

如果是 _**datetime**_ 还要折腾 _y_, _m_, _d_ 的话，用 `lubridate` 会更方便。

### 2.3 Converting a Date into a String

类似 `as.Date("11/30/1985", format="%m/%d/%Y")`，我们也可以用 `format="%m/%d/%Y"` 来指定输出的格式，比如：

```r
> format(Sys.Date())
[1] "2015-02-08"
> format(Sys.Date(), format="%m/%d/%Y")
[1] "02/08/2015"

> as.character(Sys.Date())
[1] "2015-02-08"
> as.character(Sys.Date(), format="%m/%d/%Y")
[1] "02/08/2015"
```

	

### 2.4 Converting Year, Month, and Day into a Date

Use the `ISOdate` function:

	> ISOdate(year, month, day)

The result is a `POSIXct` object that you can convert into a `Date` object:

	> as.Date(ISOdate(year, month, day))
	
`ISOdate` can process entire vectors of years, months, and days, which is quite handy for mass conversion of input data.

```r
> years
[1] 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014
> months
[1] 1 1 1 1 1
> days
[1] 15 21 20 18 17
> ISOdate(years, months, days)
[1] "2010-01-15 12:00:00 GMT" "2011-01-21 12:00:00 GMT"
[3] "2012-01-20 12:00:00 GMT" "2013-01-18 12:00:00 GMT"
[5] "2014-01-17 12:00:00 GMT"
```

Here vector of months is actually redundant and that the last expression can therefore be further simplified by invoking the Recycling Rule:

```r
> as.Date(ISOdate(years, 1, days))
[1] "2010-01-15" "2011-01-21" "2012-01-20" "2013-01-18" "2014-01-17"
```
	
This recipe can also be extended to handle year, month, day, hour, minute, and second data by using the `ISOdatetime` function:

	> ISOdatetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)

### 2.5 Getting the Julian Date

Julian date is the number of days since January 1, 1970.

Either convert the `Date` object to an integer or use the `julian` function:

```r
> d = as.Date("1985-11-30")
> as.integer(d)
[1] 5812
> julian(d)
[1] 5812
attr(,"origin")
[1] "1970-01-01"

> as.integer(as.Date("1970-01-01"))
[1] 0
> as.integer(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
[1] 1
```

### 2.6 Extracting the Parts of a Date

```r
> d <- as.Date("2010-03-15")
> p <- as.POSIXlt(d)
> p$mday 		# Day of the month
[1] 15
> p$mon 		# Month (0 = January)
[1] 2
> p$year + 1900 # Year
[1] 2010
```
	
简写形式：

```r
> as.POSIXlt(d)$mday
[1] 15
```

### 2.7 Creating a Sequence of Dates

The seq function is a generic function that has a version for `Date` objects. It can create a `Date` sequence similarly to the way it creates a sequence of numbers.

```r
> s <- as.Date("2012-01-01")
> e <- as.Date("2012-02-01")
> seq(from=s, to=e, by=1) # One month of dates
[1] "2012-01-01" "2012-01-02" "2012-01-03" "2012-01-04" "2012-01-05" "2012-01-06"
[7] "2012-01-07" "2012-01-08" "2012-01-09" "2012-01-10" "2012-01-11" "2012-01-12"
[13] "2012-01-13" "2012-01-14" "2012-01-15" "2012-01-16" "2012-01-17" "2012-01-18"
[19] "2012-01-19" "2012-01-20" "2012-01-21" "2012-01-22" "2012-01-23" "2012-01-24"
[25] "2012-01-25" "2012-01-26" "2012-01-27" "2012-01-28" "2012-01-29" "2012-01-30"
[31] "2012-01-31" "2012-02-01"
```
	
Another typical use specifies a starting date (`from`), increment (`by`), and number of dates (`length.out`): 

```r
> seq(from=s, by=1, length.out=7) # Dates, one week apart 
[1] "2012-01-01" "2012-01-02" "2012-01-03" "2012-01-04" "2012-01-05" "2012-01-06" 
[7] "2012-01-07"
```

The increment (`by`) is flexible and can be specified in days, weeks, months, or years:

```r
> seq(from=s, by="month", length.out=12) # First of the month for one year
[1] "2012-01-01" "2012-02-01" "2012-03-01" "2012-04-01" "2012-05-01" "2012-06-01"
[7] "2012-07-01" "2012-08-01" "2012-09-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-11-01" "2012-12-01"

> seq(from=s, by="3 months", length.out=4) # Quarterly dates for one year
[1] "2012-01-01" "2012-04-01" "2012-07-01" "2012-10-01"

> seq(from=s, by="year", length.out=10) # Year-start dates for one decade
[1] "2012-01-01" "2013-01-01" "2014-01-01" "2015-01-01" "2016-01-01" "2017-01-01"
[7] "2018-01-01" "2019-01-01" "2020-01-01" "2021-01-01"
```
	
Be careful with `by="month"` near month-end. In this example, the end of February overflows into March, which is probably not what you wanted:

```r
> seq(as.Date("2010-01-29"), by="month", len=3)
[1] "2010-01-29" "2010-03-01" "2010-03-29"
```
	
最后这个 `len=3` 我要说下。这个 `len=3` 是 `length.out=3` 的缩写，缩写成 `l=3` 也可以；而且 `seq` 的参数基本都是可以缩写的，比如：

```r
> seq(from=1, to=10)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(f=1, t=10)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
	
我最开始以为 `seq(f=1, t=10)` 是不是被识别成 `seq(1, 10)` 然后再根据参数的位置被识别成了 `seq(from=1, to=10)`。试验证明不是的：

```r
> seq(t=10, f=1)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(10, 1)
[1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
```

不知道是不是所有的 R function 都这样；而且万一两个参数缩写相同时该如何判断？有时间再研究。

### 2.8 Date Addition and Subtraction

```r
> d1 = as.Date("1985-11-30")

> d1 + 10
[1] "1985-12-10"
> d1 - 10
[1] "1985-11-20"

> d2 = as.Date("1995-02-16") ## 松冈茉优

> d2 - d1
Time difference of 3365 days
> d2 + d1
Error in `+.Date`(d2, d1) : binary + is not defined for "Date" objects

> difftime(d2, d1, units="weeks")
Time difference of 480.7143 weeks

> d3 = as.Date("1997-03-15") ## 黑岛结菜

> diff(c(d1,d2,d3))
Time differences in days
[1] 3365  758
```

注意，这样得到的 difference 并不能直接拿来计算，具体的数值需要 `as.numeric` 来转一下，比如：

```r
> d2 - d1
Time difference of 3365 days
> as.numeric(d2 - d1, units = "days")
[1] 3365
> as.numeric(d2 - d1, units = "secs")
[1] 290736000
```

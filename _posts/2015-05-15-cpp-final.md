## Preventing Inheritance

Under the new standard, we can prevent a class from being used as a base by following the class name with `final`:

```cpp
class NoDerived final { /* */ };	// NoDerived can't be a base class

class Base { /* */ };
class Last final : Base { /* */ };	// Last can't be a base class
```

## Preventing Overriding

We can also designate a function as final. Any attempt to override a function that has been defined as final will be flagged as an error.

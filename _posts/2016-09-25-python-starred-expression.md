## Argument Unpacking: `*expression` and `**expression` inside function calls

From [The Python Language Reference - 6.3.4. Calls](https://docs.python.org/dev/reference/expressions.html#calls):

> If the syntax `*expression` appears in the function call, `expression` must evaluate to an **_iterable_**. Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments. For the call `f(x1, x2, *y, x3, x4)`, if `y` evaluates to a sequence `y1, ..., yM`, this is equivalent to a call `f(x1, x2, y1, ..., yM, x3, x4)`.

> If the syntax `**expression` appears in the function call, `expression` must evaluate to a **_mapping_**, the contents of which are treated as additional keyword arguments. If a keyword is already present (as an explicit keyword argument, or from another unpacking), a `TypeError` exception is raised.

Pay attention to the parameter order: `*expression` syntax can appear after explicit keyword arguments, and be processed prior to the keyword arguments and any `**expression` arguments. E.g.

```python
def func(a, b ,c):
    print(a, b, c)

func(c=3, 1, 2)                # SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument
func(c=3, *(1,2))              # OK. 1 2 3
func(c=3, **dict(a=1,b=2))     # OK. 1 2 3
func(c=3, *(1,), **dict(b=2))  # OK. 1 2 3
```

## Parameter Packing: `*expression` and `**expression` in function definitions

On the other hand, from [The Python Language Reference - 8.6. Function definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions):

> If the form `*identifier` is present, it is initialized to a tuple receiving any excess positional parameters, defaulting to the empty tuple.

> If the form `**identifier` is present, it is initialized to a new dictionary receiving any excess keyword arguments, defaulting to a new empty dictionary.

- So `*args` is definitely a tuple!

Let's construct an example:

```python
def func(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)
    print(locals())

func(1, a=2)

# output:
#   (1,)
#   {'a': 2}
#   {'kwargs': {'a': 2}, 'args': (1,)}
```

The syntax of one-elemented tuples is kind of weird. Just get used to it. [The Python Language Reference - 6.14. Expression lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expression-lists) indicates:

> The trailing comma is required only to create a single tuple (a.k.a. a singleton); it is optional in all other cases. A single expression without a trailing comma doesnâ€™t create a tuple, but rather yields the value of that expression.

## Unpacking inside tuple, list, set and dictionary **_displays_**

- N.B. This PEP does NOT specify unpacking operators inside list, set or dictionary **_comprehensions_**. 

From [PEP 448 -- Additional Unpacking Generalizations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/):

```python
>>> *range(4), 4
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
>>> [*range(4), 4]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> {*range(4), 4}
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> {'x': 1, **{'y': 2}}
{'x': 1, 'y': 2}
```

In dictionaries, latter values will always override former ones:

```python
>>> {'x': 1, **{'x': 2}}
{'x': 2}
>>> {**{'x': 2}, 'x': 1}
{'x': 1}
```

- N.B. We can also call
    - `*`: iterable unpacking operator and 
    - `**`: dictionary unpacking operator

## Extended Unpacking: `*expression` on LHS of assignments

From [PEP 3132 -- Extended Iterable Unpacking](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/): 

> A tuple (or list) on the left side of a simple assignment may contain at most one expression prepended with a single asterisk (which is henceforth called a "starred" expression, while the other expressions in the list are called "mandatory").

- Mandatory expressions will be assigned the corresponding values of RHS according to their positions in the tuple (or list)
- The starred expression will catch the remainder values of RHS

E.g. if `seq` is a slicable sequence, all the following assignments are equivalent if `seq` has at least 2 elements:

```python
a, *b, c = seq
[a, *b, c] = seq
a, b, c = seq[0], list(seq[1:-1]), seq[-1]
```

- `seq[0]` is guaranteed to be assigned to `a`
- `seq[-1]` is guaranteed to be assigned to `c`
- All the remainder values in `seq` will be assigned to `b`
    - `b` is always a list as far as I experimented
- If `len(seq) == 2`, `b` will be empty

It is also an error to use the starred expression as a lone assignment target, as in

```python
*a = range(5)  # Error
```

This, however, is valid syntax:

```python
*a, = range(5)  # OK
```

This proposal also applies to tuples in implicit assignment context, such as in a `for` statement:

```python
for a, *b in [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7)]:
    print(b)
    
# output:
#   [2, 3]
#   [5, 6, 7]
```

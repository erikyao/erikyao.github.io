I really like this table of DP hierarchy from [stackoverflow: Using a strategy pattern and a command pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3896839):

Then thanks to _BalusC_'s great summary of [Examples of GoF Design Patterns in Java's core libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2707195), we can read the java source code to learn DP.

Finally I'd like to advertise [GrepCode](http://grepcode.com/), a handy tool to locate the java source code.

Enjoy!

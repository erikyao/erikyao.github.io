## Kernel

在 Chapter 6, [Digest of Essence of Linear Algebra](http://yyao.info/math/2016/11/17/digest-of-essence-of-linear-algebra) 有讲：

> The null space of matrix $A$ is the set of all vectors $\vec v$ such that $A \vec v = \vec 0$

这里我们用函数的观点展开讲一讲。

[Wikipedia: Kernel (linear algebra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra)): The **kernel** (also known as **null space** or **nullspace**) of a linear map (i.e. linear transformation) $L : V \rightarrow W$ between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$, is the set of all elements $\mathbf{v}$ of $V$ for which $L(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}$, where $\mathbf{0}$ denotes the zero vector in $W$. That is, in set-builder notation,

$$
\ker(L)=\left \{ \mathbf {v} \in V \mid L(\mathbf {v} ) = \mathbf{0} \right \}
$$

A linear map is essentially a function，so we can define:

- $L(\mathbf{v})$ is the **image** of $\mathbf{v}$ in $W$ (注意有 $L(\mathbf{v}) \in W$)
- The **image** of $L$ is $\mathrm{im}(L) = \left \\{ L(\mathbf{v}) \mid \mathbf{v} \in V \right \\}$ (所以 $\mathrm{im}(L)$ 是 $W$ 的子空间) 

Two elements of $V$ have the same image in $W$ if and only if their difference lies in the kernel of $L$:

$$
L(\mathbf{v}_{1}) = L(\mathbf{v}_{2}) \Leftrightarrow L(\mathbf{v}_{1} - \mathbf{v}_{2}) = \mathbf{0} 
$$

The image of $L$ is isomorphic to the quotient of $V$ by the kernel:

$$
\mathrm{im}(L) \cong V / \ker(L)
$$

- In linear algebra, the quotient ([ˈkwəʊʃənt], 商) of a vector space $V$ by a subspace $N$ is a vector space obtained by "collapsing" $N$ to zero. The space obtained is called a quotient space and is denoted $V/N$ (read $V$ mod $N$ or $V$ by $N$).
- Morphism refers to a structure-preserving map from one mathematical structure to another.
    - In universal algebra and in model theory, a structure consists of a set along with a collection of finitary operations (an operation that takes a finite number of input values) and relations that are defined on it.
    - Structure 的大类有 groups (群), rings (环), fields (域，比如实数域) and vector spaces
    - 比如 Vector space 的定义就是 vector 的集合以及定义在 vector 上的 add、multiply 的操作
    - structure-preserving 的意思就是你的 mapping 不能跳出 structure 的范围
- Isomorphism is a morphism that can be reversed by an inverse morphism

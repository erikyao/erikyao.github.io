Two brilliant posts on this sampling technique:

- [Lab Notes: The Alias Method for Sampling from Discrete Distributions](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/08/lab-notes-the-a.html)
- [Darts, Dice, and Coins: Sampling from a Discrete Distribution](http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/)

Great thanks to the authors!

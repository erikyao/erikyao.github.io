1. Configure an `upstream` remote for your fork, following [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork).
2. Sync your fork to the `upstream` remote, following [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).

- `upstream` is just a name of the remote which points to the original repo you forked from.
- You can name it whatever you like
